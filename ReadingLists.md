# The Importance of Curating Annotated Reading Lists

You will be programmed by the content you ingest; if you don't CONTROL the projector, you will ingest what is put in front of you ... this is why we READ, think and perform the exercise of thinking about what we have read, what new questions our reading opens up and what we should read in the future. Continually curating reading lists is about controlling the projector that is putting ideas on the screen of our subconscious.

***Reading is the fundamental foundtation necessary for thinking about improving our discipline.***

The EXERCISE of continually curating annotated reading lists is really about the routine MENTAL discipline of little habits, eg daily reading, that advance the personal discipline as well as mental/social fitness. Without the regular exercise of different knowledge development *muscles* atrophy occurs, especially in areas of knowledge where communities evolve and grow or die, the language and terminology changes, where different minds become more or less engaged.
