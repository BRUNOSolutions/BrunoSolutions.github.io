Campaigns have to be about SERVING constituents FIRST ... this is done tools or apps that serve a real need for something we need to do ourselves ... this is what [DOGFOODING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) our tools is about ... it's really up to us to make the tools, equipment, apps that we depend on.

A political campaign's assets are its *dogfooded* apps ... it is the ***process*** of developing a working, valuable PRODUCT or SERVICE together that engages the people we want in the campaign ... we do not really want people who cannot develop their own way out of their own paper bags ... a WINNING political campaign depends upon DEVELOPERS who eat their own dogfood.

So, instead of the old way of fundraising and asking donors to write checks, we look at ENLISTING ***people who BUILD things rather than watch*** as part of the development community, at least at the beta-user or prototype-expermenter level in refinement of the campaign apps ***for voters who build things*** ... it's all about ENCOURAGING a mindset and INVOLVING technical savvy users ... because, *if you're under 45* you understand why ALL of us need to be [DOGFOODING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) our own apps and toolkits now.

**Therefore, SERVING our constituents FIRST ... in a MODERN campaign, rather that some campaign for your parents out of the 90s ... is about enlisting the right constituents as knowledgeable testers, thought leaders and and co-developers as we all [dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) our own apps and tools now.** 


# Dogfooded Campaign Apps that SERVE our constituents [and our needs] FIRST!!!

 We might start with something like [a spin on Thunderbird's email/RSS reader](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/get-involved/)] ... maybe an RSS reader with added intelligence as in [NewsBlur](https://github.com/BRUNOSolutions/NewsBlur) ... the upshot of our ***DOGFOODED*** aim to ***SERVE the constituents FIRST!!!*** is that we will FIRST build something we need to use, ie a tool that helps to READ radically more [and read it better] than we are currently able to read with the toolset we have.
