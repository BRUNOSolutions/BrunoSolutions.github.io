# Free Will ... programming ... and meditation.

*Do not believe ME ... instead meditate and pay attention to the thoughts which arise in your mind.*

Voluntarism is about understanding influences, understanding the most fundamental foundations of free will. Without some competency in meditation, you will never really have legitimate free will -- you will have the illusion of free will. In other words, you can read/watch as much material as you want on voluntarism and regurgitate the ideas of as many experts/authors as you like, but without meditative awareness, you cannot begin to have free will and actually understand the will or what voluntarism is really about on a firsthand basis.

If you do not want to be a cartoon of a cartoon, ie someone listen to a psychologist getting high on his own supply, you will need to be in touch with or understand something about the programming and influences which control unconscious and subconscious precursors to your illusion of free will ... without meditation, it's much like thinking that you know what your blood glucose level or vitamin D levels are without ever having performed any sort of test ... it's a matter of calibrating the instrument and attempting to start with clean readings ... thus, there is no substitute for meditation and something like lojong practice. 

In deep meditative state, you will encounter thoughts that arise from out of nowhere -- that noisiness is evidence that there are still matters which you do not control, which impinge your free will. Once you understand something about the noisiness of your mind, you can go forward with shaping your inputs so that you have a degree of free will if you actively control the content and ideas shaping your mind ... it's doubtful whether any human can ever have a completely free will ... you will always be a product of your influences, but by explicitly acknowledging and understanding the impact of these influences, you can begin to rigorously free your mind, to rigorously free your will.
