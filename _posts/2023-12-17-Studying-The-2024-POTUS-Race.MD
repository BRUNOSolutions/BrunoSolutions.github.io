***It is NONE TOO EARLY to start thinking about the 2028 race ... or the 2032 race.***

# Civics lesson: Key Dates in how the Electoral Collage functions

One year from today ... On December 17, 2024, the Electoral College meets in each State and across the nation, 538 Electors record their votes ... the election uncertainty is basically over at that point ... on January 6, 2025, Congress meets in joint session and formally counts those electoral votes and there's NO WAY POSSIBLE that the votes have changed since December 17th.

What we should realize however is that it is basically already way, way too late for any citizen to do anything other in 2024 than just vote and help get out the vote so that all elgible voters exercise their legal right to vote.

## First, let's look at the OBVIOUS, cliche, *safe* conventional wisdom answers, ie what LLMs tell us

* Technological advancements: Improved, more widespread, more *optimized* use of social media platforms and data analytics will likely play an even more prominent role in campaigning in the future.

* Generational shifts: We're all getting older together. That was obvious long before Millennials and Gen Z started make up a significantly larger portion of the electorate ... but many strategists are still behaving like it's the 1990s or 2000s ... they really need to STOP and process the significance of the obvious fact that voters born in 2010 [and before 2010] will vote in 2028 ... THINK concretely about what that means; think about a 2010 vintage kiddo that you know ... on the other hand, a LOT of those OLD stalwart voters that mattered back in 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024 will be dead in 2028 ... it's not just that there are different people involved, the voters themselves will also be changing [and not necessarily becoming their parents] as they age, necessitating big changes in messaging, interaction and outreach tailored to a different demographic's values and priorities.

* Climate change: Concerns about the environment ... OR, conversely, concerns about the excesses of hyperactive policy that does not matter to the climate, but matters immensely to the economy ... are likely to remain high, potentially influencing policy platforms and voter choices. Depending upon a voters perspective, the man-made catastrophe of climate change OR climate change policy is VERY REAL.

* Economic uncertainty: The global economic climate in 2028 is difficult to predict, but it will be a major campaign issue FOR REASONS THAT NO ONE CURRENTLY UNDERSTANDS, ie or else, people would have reacted to those things and correspondingly, they'd be non-issues ... the cure for low corn prices is low corn prices because aberrations always motivate significant shifts/adjustments ... of course the economy will matter, FOR SOME REASON THAT WE CURRENTLY DO NOT APPRECIATE.

### Tactics and Strategy Analysis:

1. Messaging:

#### Potentially Effective:

Focusing on unity and common ground: In a polarized political climate, emphasizing shared values and solutions could appeal to moderate voters.

Addressing the concerns of younger generations: Tailoring messaging to issues like climate change, student debt, and social justice can resonate with Millennials and Gen Z.

Leveraging data-driven insights: Utilizing data analytics to personalize messaging and target specific demographics can increase effectiveness.
Potentially Ineffective:

Excessive negativity: Continued reliance on attack ads and divisive rhetoric may further alienate voters and hinder constructive dialogue.

Ignoring key issues: Avoiding important topics like climate change or economic inequality can leave voters feeling disengaged.

Failing to adapt to changing media landscapes: Sticking to traditional media outlets while neglecting new platforms like TikTok could limit reach and engagement.

#### Recommendations:

Develop a clear and concise message that focuses on the future and solutions.
Prioritize authenticity and transparency in communication.
Invest in research and data analysis to inform messaging strategies.

2. Fundraising:

Potentially Effective:

Building a strong network of small-dollar donors: Continued focus on grassroots fundraising can provide a reliable and sustainable financial base.
Utilizing emerging technologies: Exploring new avenues like cryptocurrency donations or blockchain-based fundraising platforms could attract innovative supporters.
Engaging in corporate social responsibility initiatives: Aligning the campaign with ethical business practices could attract environmentally and socially conscious donors.
Potentially Ineffective:

Overreliance on PACs and special interests: Dependence on large donors could raise concerns about undue influence and special interests.
Falling behind in technological advancements: Failing to adapt to new fundraising technologies could limit financial reach.
Neglecting diverse funding sources: Relying solely on traditional methods like fundraising dinners may not be sufficient in the future.
Recommendations:

invest in building a diversified and geographically dispersed network of donors.
Explore innovative fundraising methods while maintaining ethical practices.
Increase transparency and accountability in all fundraising activities.

3. Grassroots Organizing:

Potentially Effective:

Building community-based coalitions: Partnering with local organizations and advocacy groups can expand reach and influence beyond traditional party lines.
Leveraging social media for mobilization and engagement: Utilizing platforms like TikTok and Instagram to organize events, share information, and build community can be highly effective.
Prioritizing volunteer training and development: Investing in volunteer training programs can ensure a well-equipped and motivated grassroots network.
Potentially Ineffective:

Neglecting rural and marginalized communities: Focusing solely on urban areas can leave rural and minority voters feeling ignored and disengaged.
Failing to address voter suppression tactics: Countering misinformation and ensuring voter access in vulnerable communities is crucial in a close election.
Ignoring the power of online communities: Underestimating the potential of online activism and organizing can hinder mobilization efforts.
Recommendations:

Develop targeted outreach strategies to engage specific demographics and communities.
Utilize data analytics to identify and mobilize key supporters.
Invest in technology and social media tools to facilitate grassroots organizing and communication.
Remember, this analysis is just a starting point for further exploration. As we approach 2028, new trends and challenges will emerge, necessitating ongoing adaptation and refinement of campaign strategies. Encourage further discussion and feedback to refine this analysis and gain a deeper understanding of what might work in the future political landscape.

Disclaimer: This analysis is intended to be objective and non-partisan. However, due to the nature of political discourse, some interpretations may differ. I encourage you to critically evaluate the information presented, consider diverse perspectives, and engage in further research to form your own conclusions.

# 2024 is for CLOSELY STUDYING How to Best Run for POTUS in 2028

Stop looking in the rear view mirror, ie let the generative artificial intelligence models do that ... THINK AHEAD, THINK DIFFERENT ... this is about the JOURNEY ahead, not the one in the past. 

What we know is how backward looking campaigns tend to be ... candidates should know bettr, but they never seem to learn. For example, by January 1st, 2021, right after the 2020 elections, the STRATEGIC decisions that were going to affect the 2024 campaign were already made. AFTER that, every significant move was a matter of implementing a tactical decision. 

Now, in late 2023, it's already time to start cutting up the carcasses and do the POST-mortem autopsy on the failed candidacies of 2024.

## What does NOT work and why it fails

The race for 2024 STARTED IN EARNEST in December 2020, right after the Electoral College convened and the state legislatures across the country certified the electors. Of course, individuals that would run in 2024 had already had a LIFETIME of personal strategic decisions that had occured in the four or five decades BEFORE 2020 ... but, the CAMPAIGN for 2024, started right after the votes were tabulated and certified in 2020.

Of course, we know from history, that candidates have to have successfully DEMONSTRATED to all of those around them a pathologically level of ambition for the Oval office. Any serious candidate really must aspire ***serioiusly*** to prepare their lives to be ready for the Presidency from their youth.  There are only a few thousand [at most] people in that pool of citizen leaders -- we are not talking about those people, ie the people who will have served in a Legislature OR as a Governor OR will have started/ran a major enterprise. That is actually far more interesting, more human topic ... it's not just the Founding Fathers OR Abraham Lincoln or all kinds of biographies of major figures, studying success and leadership will be far more applicable than the topic of political campaigns.  

# Political Economics and the NEW Logic of Collective Action.

Campaign management is like the Art of War or Clausewitz's On War really boring stuff. Developing successful campaigns actually involves digging to the details of different fairly dry, technical, low-level topics in the practical organization of campaigns.

It's NOT about the drama in the Oval Office or even on the gossip on campaign bus. Campaigns like wars are an extension of politics and  political decisionmaking is really about a lot of low-level details of how things get done.  Power does not just emerge; it emerges because the parties in power have an established track record of listening to [powerful] constituents and finding ways to put together the votes or coalitions in order to get things. Making sausage is fundamentally about GRINDING and mixing and then putting the ground mix in a tube.

The new logic of collective action is about how we assemble the material that going to go into the grinder in a manner that will be successful. Of course, NOW campaingns are primarily about new things like social media, analytics and efficiently tracking the success of content generation operations and optimizing asynchronous networks of opinion leaders. Yes, we still still see old school stuff like yardsigns and billboards, blizzards of mass mailers and the even more annoying carpetbombing of advertisements across different forms of media.  
The DATA on campaigns is kind of stuff that economists and political economists and historians want to study ... but's that not where the work happens.

## SERVING constituents before elections to CONVINCE them that the candidate will serve them even better as an incumbent

Actually implementing campaigns *is*, or should be, about finding ways to SERVE CONSTITUENTS with the campaign itself ... but, we are not exactly there yet.  

Almost all campaigns are about nothing other than hot air and carpetbombing the voters with way too many promises and no actual REAL VALUE. Campaigns are still run *WRONG* ... they are STILL only about finding ways bamboozle the voters.

Actally SERVING constituents is all about LISTEN ... and OBSERVABILITY ENGINEERING.  Putting together a genuine listening network OR being something of an ombudsman or mouthpiece for aggreived voters is important, but beyond that campaigns *should* be about giving voters tools to make themselves better off ... rather than a pencil or a balloon for the kiddos, a MODERN campaign should give voters something like an convenient app to track fitness goals and make their diet more nutritious OR maybe that app should help them find better jobs or maybe network for their side hustles.  

**SERVING constituents is about us digging the well before we start getting thirsty.**

Doing this takes far, far better organizational groundwork, planning, implementation than we have seen from the currently useless and annoying campaigns in this industry.  The current state is PATHETIC ... but, as with many of our elected officials, we have gotten accustomed to pathetic.  ***DELIVERING*** on the objective of constituent service requires a strategic commitment by the campaign to be entirely about serving the constituent FIRST ... that means implementation checking, action with refactored planning followed by repition of the cycle. It's the PDCA cycle ... or DCA with refactored P and cyclic repition.

We should emphasize that it's about FIGHTING [for constituents] and revising the fight plan and continually re-implementing new plans to flank the opponent ... always be flanking ... or as what General Eisenhower at D-Day or the prizefighter Mike Tyson said about planning -- it's about getting punched in the face [to wake up], counterpunching an immediate defense as best as possible, not backing down but revising the initial plan with more of a flanking strategy and then ATTACKING the weaknesses with a more informed view ... and never quitting but repeating this cycle until the bell rings ... constant updating and revision of strategic plan that MUST preceeds serious, every day campaigning ... FIGHTING every day ... fighting led from the front from the start, from advance teams, from the candidate.

## Current campaigns will not in future campaigns work because those campaign were already pathologically BACKWARD and BACKWARD-LOOKING.

The important point is that we need to understand why the ***campaign*** for 2024 started IN EARNEST in December 2020 ... even though, most of the candiates never got that memo. The Trump campaign is really the only campaign that came close to realizing this and started [somewhat incoherently at first] putting together the Trump 2024 organization with officials working the early states immediately, or at least right after January 6 ... nobody else [who could entertain serious aspirations to be POTUS] started soon enough.

So ... to otherwise great candidates like Doug Burgum and others who are generally excellent citizen-leaders and are more than well-qualified although new to POTUS campaigns -- the big question is WHY [did you start so late]? If offering your services to be POTUS, is important to you -- WHY WAIT? ... In particular, ***WHY in the world would you wait to put together a skeletal staff until 2023 to kick off your campaign for the POTUS race in 2024?*** *If you were going to run ... exactly WHAT were you waiting for to start building your team? Obviously, you cannot do everything yourself -- by why not put together the team that will help? So ...WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU WAITING FOR?* Why get in so late?  Didn't you really BELIEVE that you were going to be a serious contender? *If you really did believe that you'd make a good President, then WHY should a qualified, capable candidate with aspirations to serve WAIT ... what is to be gained by waffling on the fence, waiting for invitation to materialize from the heavens?*  

**This timidity on the part of OTHER candidates is WHY a guy named Trump has the support he does.**

By election night of Novemer, 2022, a qualified, capable candidate for the office of POTUS should have already had a minimally-staffed campaign organization in place that, most importantly, already had the experience of directing playing a recognizable role in electing your political allies in the 2022 elections. The same WILL apply to the 2028 race ... or the 2032 race ... or beyond.

Candidates start way too LATE ... they need to shift earlier ... in the development of systems, ***shifting LEFT*** means that the development starts WAY, WAY, WAY EARLIER at a more microfoundational level, because we typically think of the project timetime as progressing timewise, reading left-to-right- ... in the practice of political campaigns, *shifting left* means, a candidate for a 2024 office should have had its intell gathering operation in place in 2021 and built that organization by electing allies for the 2022 election ... as soon as it could write a check that would not bounce, a campaign need to have a concrete organization of PAID full-time staffers who believed in that campaign -- not just some informal phone calls, but PAID staff [low-cost but dedicated staff, working out of their den at home OR mom&dad's basement] ... a concrete organization which would help you to play a role at early level fundraising activities and the like that were all about electing the next generation of political leaders, new candidates running for Legislature, Attorney General and Secretary of State and Governor in  the key states of the 2024 race ... 

**Leadership involves ambition and vision ... personal foresight and definition of a brand. WE NEED TO DIG OUR WELLS LONG BEFORE WE ARE EVER EVEN THINKING ABOUT BEING THIRSTY?** So start EARLIER ... if you are thinking about the race for 2028 ... you need to start NOW ... or, actually, you should have started earlier because you are already behind ... but the past is the past ... you can't change that ... we don't drive by looking in the rear view mirror; we drive by looking forward.  

# At this point ... 2024 is for failure analysis and post-mortem autopsies

We are coming up on what the general public recognizes as key dates, but the 2024 race is already basically over by January 1st.  Of course, there will be lots of opportunities to learn, but PRACTICALLY speaking ... the decisions that really shaped the 2024 race happened three year ago [or even before].  Large donors and even opinion leaders in small groups of friends and family members have already pretty much made up their minds about how they see things working out. So, even a year ago, was too late to build a campaign organization for 2024, but it's not too late to start building that skeletal campaign organization for 2028 and what will be put in place after the dust settles and electoral college votes are formally certified. 

Now ... study what is working, who the fresh faced rising future stars ... start locking up the talent that your campaign will need to be successful as it puts together its PAID team in December 2024 ... any aspiring candidate should have started personally long before for 2028, of course, but if you care about future races, you can start now.

## Organizing a campaign and designing a VLSI circuit share similarities

That's true in *very* general sense in terms of the planning and optimization involved ... but campaigns, because they are about human beings and the logic of collective action, far more complex.

Designing a campaign to serve a consituency of voters is *SOMEWHAT* like designing a very large-scale integrated (VLSI) logic circuit. Nobody who designs new microprocessors or logic circuits starts from scratch -- it's all about reusing intellectual property for extremely large scale information processing tasks that have been THOROUGHLY proven in generations before.  Organizing a campaign and designing a VLSI circuit share SOME similarities in terms of the planning and optimization involved. It is obviously necessary to recognize that political campaigns are far more complex than mere microprocessors, but . Here are some ways in which they are similar:

* Both involve dividing a large entity into smaller parts: In voter organization, a constituency is divided into smaller precincts or districts for better management. Similarly, in VLSI design, a large circuit is divided into smaller blocks or modules for easier design and optimization ... and then, successively more intensive refactoring, re-design and more intense optimization ... and, as time elapses and lessons are learned, the optimization of the planning continues iteratively.
* Both require careful planning and placement: In voter organization, precincts are planned and placed to ensure efficient voting processes and maximum voter turnout. In VLSI design, components are placed on the chip to minimize distance and optimize signal integrity.
* Both involve managing interconnections: In voter organization, precincts are connected to each other through voting systems and networks. In VLSI design, components are connected through wires and buses to enable communication and data transfer.
* Both require optimization for performance and efficiency: In voter organization, the goal is to maximize voter turnout and minimize wait times. In VLSI design, the goal is to minimize power consumption, reduce latency, and optimize performance.
* Both involve testing and verification: In voter organization, precincts are tested and verified to ensure accurate vote counting and security. In VLSI design, the circuit is tested and verified to ensure proper functioning and reliability.

Of course, it should be blatantly obvious to recognize that voter organization and VLSI design are fundamentally different in terms of their purpose and scope. Voter organization is focused on ensuring more fair, more efficient elections with a better-informed electorate while VLSI design is only about a simpler, more narrowly scoped task of creating complex electronic systems for various applications. This analogy is only a model for thinking about the overall roadmap of how the process needs to unfold.
