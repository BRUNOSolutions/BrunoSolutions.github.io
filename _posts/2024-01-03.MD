Let's say, just for the sake of argument, that we wanted to develop a Bruno.Solutions open source version of a personal AI trainer, which that might be somewhat similar to [Ditto.Fit](https://www.ditto.fit/)

*What would be the best way to go about it?*  Well ... MAYBE ... we should just sign up for [Ditto.Fit's beta waitlist](https://airtable.com/shruw72Azfu95ZGMG) and see what they have to offer.  Then we can decide if we want to build something similar or not.

Direct competitors:

Fitbod: AI-powered personal trainer focusing on strength training and weight lifting.

Centr: Personalized workout plans by celebrity trainers like LeBron James and Tony Horton.

Freeletics: AI-powered coaching for bodyweight workouts and HIIT.

Strava: Focuses on running and cycling, using AI to analyze performance and suggest workouts.

Pacer: AI-powered running coach that provides personalized training plans and audio coaching.

Similar ventures with different approaches:

Peloton: Offers live and on-demand fitness classes with virtual instructors.

Mirror: Interactive home gym with a large screen and personalized workouts.

Apple Fitness+: Subscription service with on-demand workout videos and guidance by Apple Watch ... *Apple product's are just like the Gillette razor blades sold to suckers who liked the Gillette design or advertisements, except the Apple fritterware cuts deeper*.

FitOn: Free workout videos across various disciplines with live and on-demand options.

Additional resources:

[Nike Valiant Labs](https://wellfound.com/company/valiantlabs/): A new internal incubation arm of Nike, focused on building businesses that serve consumers in new and unimagined ways.

Startups for Health: Tracks and reports on health-tech startups, which might include AI-powered trainers or, more generally, better adherence to a person's own holistic treatment program, like [Sweetch](https://www.sweetch.com/solutions).

Crunchbase: Search for companies categorized as "artificial intelligence" and "fitness" to find relevant ventures ... such as [ArtiFit AI Personal Trainer](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ai-personal-trainer) or [Volt Athletics](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/volt-athletics)

[Bard search](https://bard.google.com/): Using specific keywords like "AI personal trainer" or "personalized fitness app" to discover various options.
Product Hunt: Search for "fitness" or "personal trainer" to find relevant products and services.
GitHub open source repositories: Search for *recentish* ["*personal AI trainer*" repository with at least a couple forks](https://github.com/search?q=Personal+AI+trainer+created%3A%3E2017-01-01+stars%3A%3E3+forks%3A%3E2&type=repositories&ref=advsearch), such as [AasanAI](https://github.com/saRvaGnyA/AasanAI) or [MindfulMove](https://github.com/ankush-003/MindfulMove) or [MyCoach](https://github.com/Ta0uf19/MyCoach)

Then we copied the following [prompt from Surfsite.AI](https://www.app.surfsite.ai/prompts/clqec8z7r0000i108k8a2kjoe) and pasted it into the [NVIDIA's Llama 2 70](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/ai-foundation/models/llama2-70b):

    One great resource is the Open Personal AI Trainer (OPAT) community, which is an open-source platform for developing and sharing personal AI trainers. OPAT provides a range of tools and resources for creating custom treatment programs, including natural language processing, machine learning, and data analytics. The community is active and supportive, with a strong focus on collaboration and sharing knowledge.

    Another useful resource is the Coaching Toolkit, which is an open-source library of coaching tools and techniques. The toolkit includes a range of coaching methods, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and solution-focused coaching, and provides a customizable framework for creating personalized coaching plans. The toolkit is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing coaches and trainers to tailor their approach to the needs of their clients.

    If you're looking for a more comprehensive solution, you might consider the AI-powered coaching platform, LifeX. LifeX is a new venture that uses machine learning and natural language processing to provide personalized coaching and support. The platform offers a range of features, including goal-setting, habit tracking, and mood monitoring, and provides users with personalized recommendations and guidance. LifeX has received positive reviews for its effectiveness and user-friendly interface.

    Finally, if you're interested in exploring startup incubators, you might consider the AI for Good accelerator program. This program is focused on supporting startups that use AI to address social and environmental challenges, including health and wellness. The program provides mentorship, funding, and resources to help startups develop and scale their solutions.

    In terms of overcoming challenges, one potential obstacle is ensuring that personal AI trainers and coaching tools are tailored to the specific needs and goals of each individual. To address this, it's important to invest in user research and testing to ensure that the tool is effective and user-friendly. Additionally, it's important to consider ethical considerations, such as data privacy and security, and to ensure that the tool is transparent and explainable.

    I hope these resources are helpful in your search for open-source development communities, apps, new ventures, or startup incubators focused on personal AI trainers or coaching tools for custom treatment programs. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask!    

Unfortunately, there isn't enough information available online readily to definitively tell you about a specific Open Personal AI Trainer (OPAT) community. It's EITHER a new or niche community potentially using a less common acronym OR it's complete rabbithole hallucination of the kind we often see in generative AI. 

Although the generative AI response was not especially useful in a direct sense, attempt to understand where there might be some tangentially related answers did ultimately furnish an extremely helpful [page from the **Institute of Personal Trainers** on *AI tools for personal trainers*](https://www.instituteofpersonaltrainers.com/blog/ai-tools-for-personal-trainers) ... and this does sort of remind us of the EXTREMELY IMPORTANT part of campaigns and development efforts that is often overlooked: **IF anything meaninful is going to be legitimately effective, it is going to NEED TO BE PERSONAL.** 

*AI ain't gonna cut it* ... AI is really no different than expecting to fit, young and famous by looking at a 40-year-old a Jane Fonda VHS tape you just got from Goodwill ... or otherwise, AI is no different than exercise equipment that get's used as clothes drying rack, but it might have an appealing structure to wonks into matrix algebra ... or otherwise, AI is no different than a $20 fitness tracker watch pedometer that somehow got marked up a another expensive, state-of-the-art $200 FitBit or $400 iWatch quantified self fashion accessory ...

The PROBLEM with the whole "The Singularity Is Near" crowd is that AI is fundamentally impersonal and INHERENTLY inhuman. So just like VR sex, there's not going to be any PERSONAL accountability or bonding or reproduction that happens ... but the delusions will persist, because AI fanboys have invested a lot of emotional capital in AGI, but AI will FAIL.

AI has it legit uses ... AS a tool, but AI that's expected to do more will always fail because this *personal accountability flaw* that's inherent in AI. Most AI, especially AI that promises too much, is still just a gimmick and always will continue to be UNTIL people understand that AI is like a pocket calculator ... a nifty pocket calculator can do math tricks like "Multiply 8346 X 2371" faster than most humans or even faster than electromechanical adding machines, but that does mean calculator can manage a business or even do a great job every day tallying up the number eggs your chickens laid. 

# ***AI ain't gonna cut it*** until people understand that AI is just AI.
