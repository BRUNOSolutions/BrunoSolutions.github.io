# Assess your current strategy and tactics

EVERY SINGLE MOMENT of every day, always be MINDFULLY AWARE of every breath, mindful of your posture and every physical movement, as you develop a constant mental discipline of coaching, correcting, re-optimizing your health ... for the road ahead ... without your health, what do you have?

## Improve your DISCIPLINE of MINDFULNESS ... when you walk WALK

When you eat, ENJOY every bite of your food ... when you work, enjoy getting things DONE and DONE RIGHT.  

Pay attention to what you are doing ... FOCUS. 

Stop wasting your time staying angry; it is a sign of mental laziness to filled with anxiety ... focus on being FILLED with gratitude for everything that you have been given to work with. FOCUS on gratitude and being a good steward of what you have. Stop EVER being anxious about things like money or status ... when you are anxious, realize that your mental attitude has lapsed and you have slipped into a counterproductive state of pessimism, anxiety and lack of gratitude. If you cannot be grateful, you will hasten your death.

LET GO of all hate and worry and focus on what you are doing RIGHT NOW. As you master NOW, you will find that you are able to focus on the future side of now and what the road ahead looks like ... but when you lapse back into gazing in the rear view mirror, you need to STOP, get control of your mind and re-focus on what you are doing RIGHT NOW and how that impacts the road ahead. 

***LET THE DEAD BURY THEIR DEAD!!!*** Memories are fine, but STOP longing for the past ... just STOP THAT SHIT!!!

## Develop a more detailed understanding of what is driving your personal risk factors

You probably know ... but don't forget things like the fact that falls are the 3rd most prevalent cause of death for people over 65. If you can't survive an encounter with your stairs, you certainly don't need to worry about almost miniscule risks from a missed cancer screen ... the EXTRA risk of driving to your screening along with the risks of adventurous insurance-fuelled extra treatments are far more significant than a missed cancer screen. 

# Optimize your sleep hygiene

MOST IMPORTANTLY ... never ever EVER sit down and watch TV or a movie.  NEVER. Television and video destroy your ability to subconsciously process information ... the hypnosis that you take in from the television annhilates your subconscious and destroys the restful reprocessing of information during sleep.  UNPLUG your television and stop consuming television substitutes from the internet and you will be amazed at how clearly you can think

Understand what sleep hygiene is ... read more about neurology and how the subconscious brain re-processes information for you while you sleep ... it's fine to understand it conceptually, but you will really *understand* why sleep hygiene is more important than you ever thought it was, AFTER you are rested.

Try really focusing your life around just getting your rest ... so that you can think clearly to put your life, your time management on a more orderly and coherent basis.  You will be amazed at how much more productive you are [when you are not wasting your time being angry and crabby, doing thing] ... and how much more you can lead a much more productive life.

## Sleep in a cool, dark, quiet room

## The best sleep aide is having a productive day and giving it your all.

But at some point ... "Tomorrow's another day!"  So get up early, put in a solid effort all day and then, 30 minutes before bed, wind down and avoid distractions before bed.

It's best if you can spend more time outdoors and get your body in synch with the sun ... when the sun goes down early, go to bed early; it's fine to get up super early and work, but be sure to get up BEFORE sunrise every day ... if you can't sleep, get up and do something productive -- but stay away to watch the sunrise ... there's simply no way to boost your health and productivity than getting up before the sun to watch the sunrise.

## Consume caffeine in moderation, with an aim to always moderating your intake, but it is best to abstain after noontime and definitely knock it off all together after 2pm

Caffiene has unmistakable [neuroprotective effects ESPECIALLY for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6492672/) ... although caffeine has been associated with anxiety, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping; this is usually a sign of lack of moderation in consumption OR a particular sensitivity to caffiene. For example, if someone drinks a moderate amounnt of a caffienated beverage like green tea, regularly in moderate amounts, but still has chronic headaches and or even migraines, it is best for that person to abstain from caffiene altogether.  But for most people who have their anxieties under control, caffiene is a neuroprotective substance which is best consumed in moderation, but not avoided altogether. 

## Avoid alcohol AT ALL TIMES

NEVER, EVER drink alcohol ... you might think that you can drink without it affecting your thinking, but the inescapable fact of alcohol is that it is direct neurotoxin which causes inebriation and other effects, such as killing favorable portions of the gut's microbiome ... but alcohol's effect on the body is much longer lasting, low-level, persistent dementia which takes far longer to correct than just lowering blood alcohol levels ... and, since alcohol is both water- and fat-soluble, it can easily move out of the blood stream and move freely into the cells in your body where it does the most damage ... the persistence of alcohol in stay in higher lipid cells, especially brain cells is where the long term toxicity continues to bombard the system -- this is why alcohol is a persistent long-term depressant ... beyond just being in your system, the pattern of alcohol use [like marijauna use] and psychological craving for alcohol or marijauna and the rush from being around friends who drink hardwires your brain to crave being around morons who cannot think [but imagine that they are geniuses because they're high] ... you will ***understand*** why after you fully clean of all alcohol [and alcoholic friends] for 1000 days.

## IF you need them; take short 25 minute power naps during the day

Most importantly, do not get STRESSED about not being able to sleep ... if you can't sleep, get up and work on something but the next day ... if you are really dragging and too tired to focus, take a 25 minute power nap.  The MOST IMPORTANT part of the power nap is to take away any stress that comes from worrying about not being able to sleep, knowing that you NEED sleep and worrying more ... STOP WORRYING ... take a power nap when the need arises.

Don't sleep longer than 25 minutes, or you will wake up groggy and you won't just have a hard time getting back to work, your entire day and your whole sleep routine will be thrown off ... if you go back to work and find that you are still exhausted, see if taking a walk around the neighborhood help ... if you still need a nap, take just 25 minutes ... but it's best if you just try to push on and get to bed early.

# Develop nutrition plan that works for you

## MOSTLY it's about what you remove

## Drink more water ... then drink more, a LOT more.

## Get your nutrients from higher quality meats ... it's fine to get your enjoyment/satiation/crunchiness from food from vegetables ... but avoid carbs and snacks ... train your body to never crave ultra-processed foods.

## Improve your ENJOYMENT of food.

Garden, Foodscape, Build Soil. 

Preserve, Pickle, Ferment. 

Wildcraft and Forage. Most importantly, just spend more time outside PAYING ATTENTION.

Cook ... study flavors ... design your own cuisines, ie avoid ultra-processed food like the plague. 

# Exercise more THROUGHOUT the day

## Get a standing desk; NEVER ever sit unless it's on a stability ball ... but don't relax ... use your body weight to make your back and core muscles healthier

### Go for more walks ... not just a few walks,  but take lot of walks ... not to just THINK, but to SEE how things are going ... if you're worried about missing an idea, a call or a meeting -- take a smartphone or virtual comms device with you

# AVOID all drugs; avoid most supplements

## STOP SWALLOWING SHIT or thinking primarily in terms of what you can add ... living better or longer is mostly about what you remove ... REMOVE MORE first.

## Magnesium, vitamin D and maybe C, get enough iodine from salt

# Emotional health is mostly about VISION and seeing vision through to BUILD things; it's not DOING shit to stay busy
