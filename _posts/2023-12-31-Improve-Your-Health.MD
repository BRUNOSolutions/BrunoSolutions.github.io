# Assess your current strategy and tactics

EVERY SINGLE MOMENT of every day, always be optimizing your health ... for the road ahead ... without your health, what do you have?

## Improve your DISCIPLINE of MINDFULNESS ... when you walk WALK

When you eat, ENJOY every bite of your food ... when you work, enjoy getting things DONE and DONE RIGHT.  Pay attention ... stop wasting your time being angry and filled with anxiety ... LET GO of all hate and worry and focus on what you are doing RIGHT NOW. As you master NOW, you will find that you are able to focus on the future side of now and what the road ahead looks like ... but when you lapse back into gazing in the rear view mirror, you need to STOP, get control of your mind and re-focus on what you are doing RIGHT NOW and how that impacts the road ahead. 

***LET THE DEAD BURY THEIR DEAD!!!*** Memories are fine, but STOP longing for the past ... just STOP THAT SHIT!!!

## Develop a more detailed understanding of what is driving your personal risk factors

You probably know ... but don't forget things like the fact that falls are the 3rd most prevalent cause of death for people over 65. If you can't survive an encounter with your stairs, you certainly don't need to worry about almost miniscule risks from a missed cancer screen ... the EXTRA risk of driving to your screening along with the risks of adventurous insurance-fuelled extra treatments are far more significant than a missed cancer screen. 

# Optimize your sleep hygiene

MOST IMPORTANTLY ... never ever EVER sit down and watch TV or a movie.  NEVER. Television and video destroy your ability to subconsciously process information ... the hypnosis that you take in from the television annhilates your subconscious and destroys the restful reprocessing of information during sleep.  UNPLUG your television and stop consuming television substitutes from the internet and you will be amazed at how clearly you can think

Understand what sleep hygiene is ... read more about neurology and how the subconscious brain re-processes information for you while you sleep ... it's fine to understand it conceptually, but you will really *understand* why sleep hygiene is more important than you ever thought it was, AFTER you are rested.

Try really focusing your life around just getting your rest ... so that you can think clearly to put your life, your time management on a more orderly and coherent basis.  You will be amazed at how much more productive you are [when you are not wasting your time being angry and crabby, doing thing] ... and how much more you can lead a much more productive life.

## Sleep in a cool, dark, quiet room

## Avoid distractions before bed

## Avoid caffeine, maybe always, but especially after 2pm

## Avoid alcohol AT ALL TIMES

NEVER, EVER drink ... you might think that you can drink without it affecting your thinking, but alcohol is neurotoxin ... and beyond just being in your system, it hardwires [in a bad way] your brain ... will ***understand*** why after you fully clean for 2 or 3 three years.

## Take short 25 minute power naps during the day

Don't sleep longer than 25 minutes, or you will wake up groggy and you won't just have a hard time getting back to work, your entire day and your whole sleep routine will be thrown off ... if you go back to work and find that you are still exhausted, see if taking a walk around the neighborhood help ... if you still need a nap, take just 25 minutes ... but it's best if you just try to push on and get to bed early.

# Develop nutrition plan that works for you

## MOSTLY it's about what you remove

## Drink more water ... a LOT more.

## Get your nutrients from meat ... get your enjoyment of food from vegetables NOT carbs.

## Improve your ENJOYMENT of food.

Garden, Foodscape, Build Soil. 

Preserve, Pickle, Ferment. 

Wildcraft. 

Cook. 

# Exercise more THROUGHOUT the day

## Get a standing desk; NEVER ever sit unless it's on a stability ball ... but don't relax ... use your body weight to make your back and core muscles healthier

### Go for more walks ... not just a few walks,  but take lot of walks ... not to just THINK, but to SEE how things are going ... if you're worried about missing an idea, a call or a meeting -- take a smartphone or virtual comms device with you

# AVOID all drugs; avoid most supplements

## STOP SWALLOWING SHIT or thinking primarily in terms of what you can add ... living better or longer is mostly about what you remove ... REMOVE MORE first.

## Magnesium, vitamin D and maybe C, get enough iodine from salt

# Emotional health is mostly about VISION and seeing vision through to BUILD things; it's not DOING shit to stay busy
