# Assess your current strategy and tactics

Forget New Year's resolutions ... this is actually important ... DO IT ... prepare as if your life depended upon it ... because it actually does.

## Improve your DISCIPLINE of MINDFULNESS ... when you walk, WALK

When you eat, EAT ... really savor every bite of your food ... when you work, enjoy everything about how good it feels to be getting things DONE and DONE RIGHT.  

Pay more attention! You cannot possibly pay too much attention to what you are doing ... FOCUS. Most people are so distracted that they are not even aware of how distracted they are ... they are not paying attention to what they are doing when they are doing it. ALMOST everyone does this and you know that you do this sometimes as well ... STOP! Pay closer attention to what you are doing.

Stop wasting any of your time staying angry. Stop being anxious ... it's a sign of mental laziness to filled with anxiety or to hold a grudge.  You know better.

***LET THE DEAD BURY THEIR DEAD!!!*** Memories are fine, but STOP longing for the past ... just STOP THAT SHIT!!!

## Develop a more detailed understanding of what is driving your personal risk factors

You probably know ... just start working on the inventory and doing something about the higher priority things.

# Optimize your sleep hygiene

MOST IMPORTANTLY ... never ever EVER sit down and watch TV or a movie.  NEVER. Television and video destroy your ability to subconsciously process information ... the hypnosis that you take in from your media consumption hypnotizes you ... and you process that crazy twisted media crap in your sleep.

## Sleep in a cool, dark, quiet room

## The best sleep aide is having a productive day and *carpeing the living heck out of every diem.*

It's best if you can spend more time outdoors and get your body in synch with the sun ... when the sun goes down early, go to bed early; it's fine to get up super early and work, but be sure to get up BEFORE sunrise every day ... but if you can't sleep, get up and do something productive -- but stay awake long enough to watch the sunrise and CARPE THE NEW DIEM ... there's simply no way to boost your health and productivity than getting up before the sun to watch the sunrise.

## Consume caffeine in moderation, with an aim to always moderating your intake, but it is best to abstain after noontime and definitely knock it off all together after 2pm

Caffiene has unmistakable [neuroprotective effects ESPECIALLY for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6492672/) ... although caffeine has been associated with anxiety, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping; this is usually a sign of lack of moderation in consumption OR a particular sensitivity to caffiene. For example, if someone drinks a moderate amounnt of a caffienated beverage like green tea, regularly in moderate amounts, but still has chronic headaches and or even migraines, it is best for that person to abstain from caffiene altogether.  But for most people who have their anxieties under control, caffiene is a neuroprotective substance which is best consumed in moderation, but not avoided altogether. 

## Avoid alcohol AT ALL TIMES

NEVER, EVER drink alcohol ... alcohol is direct neurotoxin which causes inebriation and other effects, such as killing favorable portions of the gut's microbiome ... but alcohol's effect on the body is MUCH longer lasting than a pleasant buzz ... alcohol is both water- and fat-soluble, it can easily move out of the blood stream and move freely into the cells in your body where it does the most depressive, mind-rotting damage OVER THE MONTHS AFTER THE BUZZ IS GONE ... the persistence of alcohol in stay in higher lipid cells, especially brain cells is where the long term toxicity necessarily continues to bombard the system, even when you think you're over it.

You will not fully ***understand*** why being clean of all alcohol [and alcoholic friends] matters until you've gone 1000 days without a drink ... 1000 days before January 1, 2024 was the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, November 24, 2020.

## IF you need them; take short 25 minute power naps during the day

Most importantly, do not get STRESSED about not being able to sleep ... if you can't sleep, get up and work on something but the next day ... Don't sleep longer than 25 minutes, or you will wake up groggy and you won't just have a hard time getting back to work, your entire day and your whole sleep routine will be thrown off ... so if you can manage somehow, ie do some exercises or go for a walk, it's best if you just try to push on and get to bed early.

# Develop nutrition plan that works for you

## MOSTLY it's about what you remove

## Drink more water ... then drink more, a LOT more.

## Get your nutrients from higher quality meats ... it's fine to get your enjoyment/satiation/crunchiness from food from vegetables ... but avoid carbs and snacks ... train your body to never crave ultra-processed foods.

## Improve your ENJOYMENT of food.

Garden, Foodscape, Build Soil. 

Preserve, Pickle, Ferment. 

Wildcraft and Forage. Most importantly, just spend more time outside PAYING ATTENTION.

Cook ... study flavors ... design your own cuisines, ie avoid ultra-processed food like the plague. 

# Exercise more THROUGHOUT the day

## Get a standing desk; NEVER ever sit unless it's on a stability ball ... but don't relax ... use your body weight to make your back and core muscles healthier

### Go for more walks ... not just a few walks,  but take lot of walks ... not to just THINK, but to SEE how things are going ... if you're worried about missing an idea, a call or a meeting -- take a smartphone or virtual comms device with you

# AVOID all drugs; avoid most supplements

## STOP SWALLOWING SHIT or thinking primarily in terms of what you can add ... living better or longer is mostly about what you remove ... REMOVE MORE first.

## Magnesium, vitamin D and maybe C, get enough iodine from salt

# Emotional health is mostly about VISION and seeing vision through to BUILD things; it's not DOING shit to stay busy
