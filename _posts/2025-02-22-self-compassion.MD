If somebody actually REALLY cares about you, they want to ask you, compassionately but in manner appropriate for your level of development that expects greatness and achievement, "What did you get done today?"

Self-compassion needs to be driven by the compassion for one's future self AND the better world that the future high-agency self will enables ... as our Creator loves us, our Creators EXPECTS greater things from us -- but our Creator is also merciful and understands that trying to create a better world is frustrating, thankless and impossibly hard. Our Creator will never give up on us or our missions -- the essence of being a warrior is to never give up on the mission.

## The Starter Set of Self-Compassion Questions

Take your time with these 100 question in the list ... in the list's TOTALITY. They are for you to ponder -- there are not right or wrong answers, EXCEPT that ducking any question is very definitely the wrong approach to pondering the questions. 

Read the entire list slowly, let the questions sink in ... JUST reading the list and letting the questions really sink in might be enough for the first time or two.

EVENTUALLY, after you've read/digested the whole list, you are going to craft your own set of 10 questions ... it's probably best to go with quality over quantity, but we'll set the number at ten -- *you can raise or lower that number, but pick a number that works, a number that you will actually USE.*

You want to end up the ten very best, very toughest, vert most compassionate but still driving questions that allow you to look in the mirror and ask yourself each day that go to the heart of "What did you get done today?"

## The Assignment

Now that you have read the full list over a couple times, you might notice some that seem redundant ... some might seem trite ... others might make you slightly uneasy or uncomfortable. The questions on the list are just simple questions ... but NOW the toughest part of assignment is up to you.

Come up with TEN questions that you will ask yourself EVERY DAY.

You might pick ten that hit hard and feel right for you, or you might blend a few into hybrid questions that pack a punch. For example, combining "Did I push past discomfort?" and "Did I make progress on a goal?" could become "Did I push through discomfort to move a goal forward?"  But the style of the question has to be something that is authentic and best for you. 

Your ten questions might change as you change ... or they might be consistent.

The assignment is NOT for anybody else ... your questions should be designed by you for you to spark your own self-awareness, accountability, and growth while balancing a degree of kindness toward yourself ... you probably want to make sure they’re tough enough to keep you honest, kind enough to keep you going, and driving or inspiring enough to push you in ways that you need to be pushed. The best form of motivation does not come from a boss or coach or some external force -- it comes from within, from within the soul that your Creator created your soul to be.
