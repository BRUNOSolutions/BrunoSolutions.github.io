#### Extreme TBD Warning

This is very much adhoc **To Be Determined** territory ... these are only five IDEAs for slightly more serious consideration  ...and a list of other brainstormed potentially implement-able approaches.

## Community Exercise and Fitness Improvement Programs for Floodplain Land

This is one of five PROPOSED approaches to transform FEMA-purchased floodplain properties from a maintenance burden into valuable community assets that use these proposed approach(s) to enhance physical fitness, ecological function, and community connection. By respecting the natural flood cycle and avoiding permanent structures, these programs create sustainable, resilient fitness opportunities while honoring the essential role of floodplains in watershed health.

The approaches, each with **no financial expenditure or Administrative resources from the City government**, utilize nothing but vacant FEMA floodplain land and volunteer labor from those KEY VOLUNTEERS who commit [with a suggested $50/yr donation to defray administrative expense] sign up to participate physically in making these social community fitness-betterment approaches work, are as follows:

1) [Walking Trail Network](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/1-Floodplain-Walking-Trail-Network.html) ... would establish a system of natural surface walking paths throughout FEMA-purchased floodplain properties, creating an interconnected network of trails that promote regular physical activity while respecting floodplain restrictions. This approach is based on successful models from communities in Vermont, North Carolina, and Iowa that have maintained floodplain trail systems for over 25 years.

2) [Fitness Equipment Circuit](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/2-Floodplain-Fitness-Equipment-Circuit.html) ... would create a distributed network of flood-resilient fitness stations throughout FEMA-purchased properties, connected by walking paths. All elements are designed to withstand or be easily removed before flooding events. This approach is based on successful models from flood-prone communities in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and parts of Australia that have maintained flood-adaptive fitness circuits for 15+ years.

3) [Field Sports Program](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/3-Floodplain-Field-Sports-Program.html) ... utilize FEMA-purchased properties as natural playing fields for various recreational activities requiring minimal permanent infrastructure. All equipment is portable and activities are designed to adapt to seasonal changes in the floodplain. This approach is modeled after successful programs in floodplain communities in Tennessee, Virginia, and parts of the Northeast operating for 20+ years.

4) [Foraging and Natural Movement Program](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/4-Floodplain-Foraging-and-Natural-Movement-Program.html) ... creates structured opportunities for physical activity through seasonal wild edible harvesting, natural movement, and ecological stewardship on FEMA-purchased floodplain properties. This approach combines nutrition education with varied physical activities while enhancing floodplain ecological function. The model is based on successful programs in river communities in Wisconsin, Oregon, and parts of New England that have operated sustainably for 20+ years.

5) [Cultural Heritage Fitness Trail](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/5-Cultural-Heritage-Fitness-Trail.html) ...creates a fitness program by connecting physical activity with the cultural and natural history of the floodplain through an interpretive trail system with associated activities. This approach is modeled after successful programs in river communities in Kentucky, South Carolina, and parts of the Midwest operating for 25+ years.

As noted, KEY VOLUNTEERS who express commitment would be necessary; the annual suggested donation is *only suggested*, but what is necessary is a firm pledge of intention to stick with the idea and see it through.

Each of these approaches would be modeled upon something that have proven to be sustainable and successful in other communities of this size for decades. We can learn from these examples of what has worked and also avoid what has not worked.

There is no implied priority in this ordering of five. Each of the proposed approaches could be implemented individually OR multiples may be combined into ONE integrated system utilizing different sections of the floodplain for complementary activities. All five approaches emphasize volunteer leadership, minimal infrastructure, and adaptation to natural cycles, ensuring long-term sustainability with minimal ongoing costs.


The specific approach examined in this document is the third one.

## Approach 3: Floodplain Field Sports Program

### Operations Management Summary

**Program Overview:**
The Floodplain Field Sports Program utilizes FEMA-purchased properties as natural playing fields for various recreational activities requiring minimal permanent infrastructure. All equipment is portable and activities are designed to adapt to seasonal changes in the floodplain. This approach is modeled after successful programs in floodplain communities in Tennessee, Virginia, and parts of the Northeast operating for 20+ years.

**Core Components:**
- Designated multi-use play areas on suitable floodplain sections
- Portable equipment for various field sports and games
- Regular scheduled activities led by volunteer coaches
- Intergenerational and family-focused participation
- Seasonal adaptation based on ground conditions
- Community field day events and friendly tournaments

**Volunteer Structure:**
- Program Coordinator (1 volunteer): Oversees scheduling, recruitment
- Field Managers (3-5 volunteers): Prepare and monitor playing areas
- Activity Leaders (8-12 volunteers): Coach specific sports/games
- Equipment Team (3-4 volunteers): Maintain and distribute equipment
- Special Event Team (5-7 volunteers): Organize tournaments and field days

**Resource Requirements:**
- Portable sports equipment
- Removable field markers
- Mobile storage solution (off-site)
- First aid supplies
- Communication system
- Weather monitoring equipment

**Implementation Timeline:**
1. **Month 1-2**: Identify suitable play areas, assess ground conditions
2. **Month 3-4**: Develop activity schedule, acquire initial equipment
3. **Month 5**: Train volunteer leaders, establish field protocols
4. **Month 6-7**: Launch initial weekly activities
5. **Month 8-9**: Gather participant feedback, expand offerings
6. **Month 10-12**: Host first community field day, evaluate program

**Sustainability Mechanisms:**
- Seasonal rotation of activities based on ground conditions
- Equipment storage in flood-safe locations
- Regular field condition assessment and activity adaptation
- Weather monitoring and cancellation protocols
- Continuous recruitment of activity leaders

**Measured Outcomes:**
- Participation metrics across age groups
- Leader retention and development
- Range of activities offered
- Field condition assessment
- Participant fitness improvements

### Project Implementation Summary

**Field Area Selection and Preparation:**
- Identify areas with good drainage and suitable topography
- Create minimal-impact field boundaries using portable markers
- Establish rotating use patterns preventing over-use
- Develop natural drainage enhancement techniques
- Create field condition assessment protocol
- Design adaptation strategies for varying conditions

**Activity Selection Framework:**
- Identify sports/games appropriate for variable ground conditions
- Develop modified rules for flood-adaptive play
- Create progressive skill development opportunities
- Balance competitive and cooperative activities
- Design activities requiring minimal ground marking
- Create all-weather activity alternatives

**Equipment Management System:**
- Develop inventory of portable sports equipment
- Create secure, off-site storage location
- Establish equipment check-out procedures
