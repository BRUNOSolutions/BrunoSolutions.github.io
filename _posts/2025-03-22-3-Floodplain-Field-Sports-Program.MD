## Extreme TBD Warning

This is very much adhoc **To Be Determined** territory.  *I am* **only just starting** *to* ***vibe engineer*** *these different ideas. Ultimately I intend to adapt the five community fitness proposals as approaches to take advantage of FEMA-purchased floodplain land, focusing on building fitness and wellness while respecting floodplain restrictions (no permanent structures, fences, or anything that would be damaged by flooding).*


## Community Exercise and Fitness Improvement Programs for Floodplain Land

This is one of five PROPOSED approaches to transform FEMA-purchased floodplain properties from a maintenance burden into valuable community assets that use these proposed approach(s) to enhance physical fitness, ecological function, and community connection. By respecting the natural flood cycle and avoiding permanent structures, these programs create sustainable, resilient fitness opportunities while honoring the essential role of floodplains in watershed health.

The approaches, each with no budget outlays from the City, utilizing nothing but vacant FEMA floodplain land and volunteer labor from those who commit [with a suggested $50/yr donation to defray administrative expense] sign up to participate physically in making these social community fitness-betterment approaches work, are as follows:

1) Walking Trail Network
2) Fitness Equipment Circuit
3) Field Sports Program
4) Foraging and Natural Movement Program
5) Cultural Heritage Fitness Trail

The specific approach examined in this document is the third one.

## Approach 3: Floodplain Field Sports Program

### Operations Management Summary

**Program Overview:**
The Floodplain Field Sports Program utilizes FEMA-purchased properties as natural playing fields for various recreational activities requiring minimal permanent infrastructure. All equipment is portable and activities are designed to adapt to seasonal changes in the floodplain. This approach is modeled after successful programs in floodplain communities in Tennessee, Virginia, and parts of the Northeast operating for 20+ years.

**Core Components:**
- Designated multi-use play areas on suitable floodplain sections
- Portable equipment for various field sports and games
- Regular scheduled activities led by volunteer coaches
- Intergenerational and family-focused participation
- Seasonal adaptation based on ground conditions
- Community field day events and friendly tournaments

**Volunteer Structure:**
- Program Coordinator (1 volunteer): Oversees scheduling, recruitment
- Field Managers (3-5 volunteers): Prepare and monitor playing areas
- Activity Leaders (8-12 volunteers): Coach specific sports/games
- Equipment Team (3-4 volunteers): Maintain and distribute equipment
- Special Event Team (5-7 volunteers): Organize tournaments and field days

**Resource Requirements:**
- Portable sports equipment
- Removable field markers
- Mobile storage solution (off-site)
- First aid supplies
- Communication system
- Weather monitoring equipment

**Implementation Timeline:**
1. **Month 1-2**: Identify suitable play areas, assess ground conditions
2. **Month 3-4**: Develop activity schedule, acquire initial equipment
3. **Month 5**: Train volunteer leaders, establish field protocols
4. **Month 6-7**: Launch initial weekly activities
5. **Month 8-9**: Gather participant feedback, expand offerings
6. **Month 10-12**: Host first community field day, evaluate program

**Sustainability Mechanisms:**
- Seasonal rotation of activities based on ground conditions
- Equipment storage in flood-safe locations
- Regular field condition assessment and activity adaptation
- Weather monitoring and cancellation protocols
- Continuous recruitment of activity leaders

**Measured Outcomes:**
- Participation metrics across age groups
- Leader retention and development
- Range of activities offered
- Field condition assessment
- Participant fitness improvements

### Project Implementation Summary

**Field Area Selection and Preparation:**
- Identify areas with good drainage and suitable topography
- Create minimal-impact field boundaries using portable markers
- Establish rotating use patterns preventing over-use
- Develop natural drainage enhancement techniques
- Create field condition assessment protocol
- Design adaptation strategies for varying conditions

**Activity Selection Framework:**
- Identify sports/games appropriate for variable ground conditions
- Develop modified rules for flood-adaptive play
- Create progressive skill development opportunities
- Balance competitive and cooperative activities
- Design activities requiring minimal ground marking
- Create all-weather activity alternatives

**Equipment Management System:**
- Develop inventory of portable sports equipment
- Create secure, off-site storage location
- Establish equipment check-out procedures
- Design weather-triggered equipment protection protocol
- Create equipment maintenance schedule
- Develop sanitization protocols between uses

**Participation Structure:**
- Create consistent activity format (warm-up, instruction, play, cool-down)
- Develop modified rules ensuring inclusive participation
- Establish team formation strategies encouraging skill development
- Create role rotation system ensuring equal participation
- Design appropriate competitive frameworks
- Develop skill-building progressions for all activities

**Seasonal Adaptation Strategy:**
- Create seasonal activity calendar reflecting ground conditions
- Develop alternative activities for wet periods
- Establish field rotation system preserving play surfaces
- Design "quick-switch" planning for weather changes
- Create specialized activities highlighting seasonal conditions
- Develop winter programming for frozen or snow-covered conditions

**Community Building Elements:**
- Implement post-activity social time
- Create participant skill-sharing opportunities
- Establish tradition of seasonal celebration events
- Design community workdays maintaining field areas
- Create photography and storytelling projects documenting activities
- Develop special intergenerational events
