# These annotated reading lists will not include proprietary packages or papers from journals with a pay wall 

# Introduction

One learns different languages in order to read different bodies of literature in the original ... although, as with our other reading lists, we are mostly interested in the communities that great works spawn, so we are very much interesting in the translations [and discussion of translations] of important texts such as [Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé](http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Jamg%C3%B6n_Kongtrul_Lodr%C3%B6_Tay%C3%A9)'s [The Five Great Treasures](http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=The_Five_Great_Treasures).  

Of course, we can and should read the translations ... but at some point, language will matter because the community of curators, annotators and authors which follow great works is maybe greater than the works themselves ... this seems to be universally true, whether it be Nietsche or Dostoevsky and other somewhat modern works in German or Russian or the ancient works in Chinese, Hindu or Sanskit -- but the lineage matters. We tend not to want to play childrens' game of one child after another whispering a secret to the next child in the cirlce, ie we NEVER trust gossips, not just because of this lineage issue, but also because gossips and translators have agendas. 

Reading ancient texts does not take away from the value of MODERN needs to learn ... as knowledge professionals we must LEARN every day and if we don't learn, we can be 100% certain that our professional objectivity is no longer what it should be ... so every single day we re-learn how to learn, we learn to think more mathematically, to more statistically consider the design of experiments to capture the most insight with the least experimental cost, to better consider what insights the available data might yield under a different model, to shrewdly implement well-architected test-in-production systems using the philosophy of Unix and the best practices of agile programming ... but meditative awareness is about the prayerful and meditative discipline of improving one's mental fitness to constantly improvement in the practice of being more aware of how one is thinking ... the reason for reading and annotating curated reading lists in this area is ***to get to that point where one practices meditating habitually without even thinking about meditating*** ... realizing, of course, that no living human ever gets there and stays in that state.

Different cultures see Life VERY differently ... American culture is an extremely materialist culture which celebrates the lowest of low common denominator acquisitive thinking in which some people ignornantly judge success as a matter of material acquisitiveness, particularly in terms of the dynastic burdens of sustained material acquisition over generations and generations of family members who are saddled with the same pathological materialist fascination. Americans tend to be excessively competitive in a materialist sense ... as such, their fitness for material acquisition is unrivaled and constantly improving -- but their mental and spiritual lives tend to be improverished ... it's like the obese poor person consuming excessive calories and addicted to sweets and tasty foods -- that person is not going to compete in or watch the Olympics, not going to have a chance of having anything like a normal social/professional life, not going to have a full life EXCEPT when it comes to acquistion of cheap calories like Doritos, pizzas, ice cream and snacks ... Americans don't aquire junk food -- they acquire junk assets, junk real estate, junk possessions which, like junk food, only inspire the addiction for more and more and more junk.

Obviously, there are far more mental states than just those that we can identify with descriptive language, but we should try to realize that it's a lot more complicated for any given individual than just these fifty one mostly common states ... you are more complicated than what you even recognize you are and other people are likely to be even more complicated than you are ... 51 states is the tip of the iceberg ... almost everyone else gets that people are far from static or consistnt and that every single day is lot more complicated than Happy Vs Sad, Good Vs Bad, Moody Vs Pragmatic.

In order to deal effectively with people, you have to be able to STFU and listen ... when you want to say something, you need to double down on the SFTU part and listen some more ... if you have something that is actually important to say, it will be likely that people can either read your mind OR will beg you to speak.
