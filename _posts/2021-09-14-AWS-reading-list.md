***AWS is OVERWHELMING*** ... that's a bit of an understatement, but also something that should never be forgotten ... AWS is going to offer more power than any individual can obtain anywhere else; it is probably going to offer that power at an extremely competitive cost, but AWS does have exceptionally tough competition which, if AWS was not overwhelming enough, are *in a collective sense* more overwhelming, possibly more cost-effective and compelling than AWS ... nonetheless, understanding AWS's offering is the key to understanding AWS's competition. 

You might have imagined that you don't really need to know about AWS ... but, if you are serious about information technology, your own computing power, storage and AI/ML hardware will represent [likely inferior]competition to AWS, so you really should understand AWS* ***before you make any significant additions to either collections of computing/storage hardware or subscriptions to cloud computing/storage/AI services.***

It is **necessary**, when one is starting out, to break something so immense and powerful down into its [Fundamentals or Core Concepts](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/fundamentals-core-concepts/). In terms of AWS fundamentals, there are **Five Pillars** which are EACH individually necessary to understand in order to use AWS effectively and efficiently without incurring unnecessary costs. In order to save time and money, study these five pillars ... these pillars come directly from *"the master's own experience"*.  Other offerings, such as Microsoft Azure or the Google Compute Platform will also bring in that organizations experience -- again, each competitor should be understood in relation to AWS; just as AWS should be understood in relation to its collective population of competitors.

Using AWS depends entirely upon understanding AWS as AWS understands AWS. You will use services according to their language, their concepts and any disputes will be resolved according to AWS ways of thinking about these things. Moreover, every single person representing AWS is at AWS because of AWS ... AWS's offering exists ONLY because of Amazon's decades of successful and profitable experience in building [well-architected framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/). 

There is not really a good alternative to understanding how AWS thinks about its Five Pillars. Many are indirectly affected by AWS and what cloud computing/storage/AI changes the economy, but yet they will somehow imagine that they do not need to understand anything about AWS. Of course,if you have an account with AWS, understanding the langauge is going to be necessary. Yes, it might be something that one should have a superficial understanding before one signs up for an AWS account, but there are some things to learn which [might be free when done correctly but] will require an AWS account. So, there's no time like the present. One should remember that there are far worse uses of one's time than critically studying and internalizing the discipline of AWS's Five Pillars:

* [Operational Excellence](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/welcome.html) in the cloud is defined by its four areas of best practices: [organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/organization.html), [prepare](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/prepare.html), [operate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/operate.html), [evolve](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/evolve.html). These four areas drive five design principles: 1) perform operations as code; 2) make small, frequent, reversible changes; 3) refine operational procedures frequently; 4) anticipate failures to remove the failure mode or mitigate the severity; and 5) commit to learning from all operational failures. In order to build understanding of these principles, it's necessary to perform [with your AWS account] the following 100 level foundational labs; an AWS account is required: [Inventory and Patch Management](https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/100_labs/100_inventory_patch_management/) and [Dependency Monitoring](https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/operational-excellence/100_labs/100_dependency_monitoring/) 

* [Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/welcome.html) is defined by its four areas of best practices. In order to internalize your understanding of the Security Pillar, it is necessary to perform [with your AWS account] the following labs and quests:
  * Level 100 [AWS Account Setup and Root User]([AWS Account Setup and Root User](https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/100_labs/100_aws_account_and_root_user/))

* [Reliability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html) is defined by its four areas of best practices: [foundations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/foundations.html), [workload architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/workload-architecture.html), [change management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/change-management.html) and [failure management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/failure-management.html). These four areas drive five design principles: 1) automatically recover from failure; 2) test recovery procedures; 3) scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability; 4) stop guessing capacity; and 5) manage change in automation. In order to internalize your understanding of the Security Pillar, it is necessary to perform [with your AWS account] the following labs:
