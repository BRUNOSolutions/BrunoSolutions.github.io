#### Extreme TBD Warning

This is very much adhoc **To Be Determined** territory ... these are only five IDEAs for slightly more serious consideration  ...and a list of other brainstormed potentially implement-able approaches.


## Community Exercise and Fitness Improvement Programs for Floodplain Land

This is one of five PROPOSED approaches to transform FEMA-purchased floodplain properties from a maintenance burden into valuable community assets that use these proposed approach(s) to enhance physical fitness, ecological function, and community connection. By respecting the natural flood cycle and avoiding permanent structures, these programs create sustainable, resilient fitness opportunities while honoring the essential role of floodplains in watershed health.

The approaches, each with **no budget outlays from the City**, utilize nothing but vacant FEMA floodplain land and volunteer labor from those who commit [with a suggested $50/yr donation to defray administrative expense] sign up to participate physically in making these social community fitness-betterment approaches work, are as follows:

1) Walking Trail Network
2) Fitness Equipment Circuit
3) Field Sports Program
4) Foraging and Natural Movement Program
5) Cultural Heritage Fitness Trail

The specific approach examined in this document is the second one.

## Approach 2: Floodplain Fitness Equipment Circuit

### Operations Management Summary

**Program Overview:**
The Floodplain Fitness Equipment Circuit creates a distributed network of flood-resilient fitness stations throughout FEMA-purchased properties, connected by walking paths. All elements are designed to withstand or be easily removed before flooding events. This approach is based on successful models from flood-prone communities in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and parts of Australia that have maintained flood-adaptive fitness circuits for 15+ years.

**Core Components:**
- Rustic, flood-resilient fitness stations using natural materials
- Circuits designed for progressive fitness development
- Mobile equipment components stored off-site during flood warnings
- Interpretive signage explaining exercises and flood adaptation
- Regular group fitness sessions led by volunteers
- Seasonal fitness challenges utilizing the circuit

**Volunteer Structure:**
- Circuit Coordinator (1 volunteer): Oversees entire program
- Station Stewards (6-8 volunteers): Monitor and maintain specific stations
- Fitness Leaders (8-10 volunteers): Lead group workout sessions
- Equipment Managers (3-4 volunteers): Handle mobile equipment
- Flood Response Team (5-7 volunteers): Coordinate pre/post flooding protocols

**Resource Requirements:**
- Natural materials for permanent elements (logs, stones, earth berms)
- Mobile equipment components (stored off-site)
- Removable instructional signage
- Tool kit for maintenance
- Weather alert system
- First aid kits for fitness leaders

**Implementation Timeline:**
1. **Month 1-2**: Map suitable locations across floodplain properties
2. **Month 3-4**: Design and install initial fitness stations
3. **Month 5**: Train volunteer fitness leaders
4. **Month 6-7**: Launch guided circuit sessions
5. **Month 8-9**: Gather user feedback, refine stations
6. **Month 10-12**: Implement first seasonal fitness challenge, evaluate program

**Sustainability Mechanisms:**
- Flood-resilient design using primarily natural materials
- Regular maintenance integrated into fitness activities
- Seasonal assessment and adaptation of station elements
- Flood response protocols protecting mobile components
- Progressive programming maintaining participant interest

**Measured Outcomes:**
- Station usage metrics
- Participation in guided sessions
- User progression through fitness levels
- Equipment condition post-flooding
- Community knowledge of fitness principles

### Project Implementation Summary

**Flood-Resilient Station Design:**
- Utilize natural materials that withstand periodic inundation
- Create balance beams from secured logs
- Develop step platforms from arranged stones
- Establish pull-up bars on flood-resistant posts
- Design earth-berm stations for step-ups and jumps
- Create stations requiring no permanent infrastructure

**Mobile Component System:**
- Develop inventory of portable fitness elements
- Create secure, off-site storage location
- Establish check-out system for group leaders
- Design weather-triggered removal protocol
- Create equipment maintenance schedule
- Develop replacement plan for worn components

**Circuit Programming Development:**
- Create progressive workout sequences utilizing stations
- Develop beginner, intermediate, and advanced circuits
- Design adaptive options for various fitness levels
- Create specialty circuits (senior-focused, family-friendly)
- Develop challenge cards for self-guided workouts
- Establish group session formats and schedules

**Educational Integration:**
- Design instruction sheets for each exercise station
- Create information about muscle groups being worked
- Develop progressive fitness training principles
- Create connection between exercise and everyday activities
- Design informational elements about flood resilience
- Create "fitness passport" tracking system for participants

**Community Activation Strategy:**
- Schedule regular guided circuit sessions
- Create monthly fitness challenges
- Develop special event workouts (solstice celebration, etc.)
- Establish "circuit champion" recognition program
- Create friendly team competitions
- Develop community fitness goals with celebration events

**Post-Flood Protocols:**
- Create assessment checklist for station inspection
- Develop station restoration procedures
- Establish community workday system for major repairs
- Create documentation process tracking flood impacts
- Design flexible programming during recovery periods
- Develop celebration events marking circuit restoration
