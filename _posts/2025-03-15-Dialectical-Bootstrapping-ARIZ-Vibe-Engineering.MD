Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has forecasted that within 3 to 6 months, AI will [generate 90% of all code, and within 12 months, AI might produce nearly all code.](https://x.com/slow_developer/status/1899430284350616025). As one should expect, obviously there are skeptics, like Linus Torvalds, who justifiably react that [AI is 90% marketing and 10% reality](https://x.com/Austen/status/1899485989518631104), which in all likelihood, *might be about as right as any knowledgeable person who doesn't have all the eggs in the AI basket can project* ... EVEN if Torvalds nails it OR that AI is only 5% reality or even a fraction of it, that small percentage is pretty spectacular, and maybe as much as humans can take in ... the FACT of the matter about all science, all technology is that **even if we conquer the seemingly boundless expanse of the frontiers just ahead of us, there will always be infinitely** ***NEWER*** **frontiers beyond those now new frontiers to explore.**

1) Even, if AI tools accelerates productivity of just HALF of the rate that information technology that Moore's Law did, it still amounts to thousandfold gains every 20 years ... which necessarily has to disrupt human ideas about institutions and culture ... because, on top of *just AI*, if you add in *other big new things* ... particular if those *other big new things* are boosted by smarter, AI-assisted IDEs and dev-extensible open sourcery of info technologies, ie as with turbocharging the competition in DevOps with extensible Linux [especially for K8s] rather than license-constrained Windows or MacOS or old ATT/HP Unix OR Git/GitHub/GitLab rather than Visual Studio Team Edition OR MySQL/MariaDB rather than Oracle or SQL Server OR the Python ecosystem rather than Matlab ... well, let's just say, 2035 might not be recognizable ... even if Linus is right about AI. Because of all the OTHER big new things.

2) It's not just the law of steady, incessant compounding ... BUT is the SLOW, steady, sustainable, quasi-predictable compounding that actually what drives economic growth ... predictable ROI encourages investment, enabling steady, consistent productivity improvement ... whereas the ridiculously overhyped gushing about AI is fine for those IN THE AI INDUSTRY, because the Revolution is happening in them, in their circles of colleagues ... but for the REST of the economy, investment in AI and new AI technologies will be driven by more predictable, realistically skeptical practical assessments of what will happen in six months, a year, five years, ten years. 

3) If AI is as significant as discovery of fire OR the use of the wheel in transport carts  and then mechanisms, well, very few are going to complain after THE FACT ... if the actual goods appeared like a magic pony ... but the amount gushing overhype is actually detrimental to wider scale adoption because, it's not just that investors need a degree of predictability to commit capital, ordinary people also need a degree of predictability in order to push on in life ... or otherwise, it becomes typical, for those left behind, to state something like "We are so fucked!" and it's not *just* them saying that -- they actually really believe it. So they will FIGHT adoptions of the technology grumpily at first, then violently, because they believe that they have nothing to lose, ie Luddite reactionary or Communist behavior is rational given the victim mindset of the Luddite reactionary or Communist. The point is astonishing evolutionary growth is fine; there will be winners/losers, but the generally rising tide lifts all boats -- revolutionary, radically disruptive growth will spawn revolutions from those who fear being left behind ... Win-Lose or Lose-Win scenarios of any kind of game played out in supergames always degrade to Lose-Lose scenarios.

Of course, even before the recent statements about what AI will do, the software development community was justifiably all abuzz about the innately [SOCIAL trend that '***vibe coding*** represents](https://gemini.google.com/app/e3a900f51f6a920e),' in which developers or maybe we should say hackers use AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to generate code from high-level descriptions. This approach is celebrated for its efficiency in creating simple applications and UI designs, enhancing productivity. Of course, there's skepticism regarding vibe coding effectiveness for complex software projects, where traditional coding skills like system architecture understanding and manual debugging are still deemed essential. Vibe coding is inherently social coding or engagement with other hackers who are also prioritizing the feeling and social atmosphere of a hacker's digital interface. It's not only fun, but the early examples are promising. For example, the release of Windsurf Wave 4, with features like Previews and Cascade Auto-Linter, supports this new coding paradigm by facilitating quick UI adjustments and maintaining code quality.

The key is **JUST DO IT!** That is, of course, what vibe coding or health hacking are completely about. Of course, it's important to embrace the open-source ethos, prioritize ethical considerations, and foster a collaborative spirit to harness the power of Generative AI for personalized and accessible lifestyle advice ... but the key is just get started, make something, fail, learn as much as possible and iterate, but to **JUST DO IT!** 

In order to start getting some practical experience with how vibe coding might work for **something PRACTICAL**, ie *not just a computer game* for distractification ... *but something practical, so that we might begin train ourselves how to think in an AI-assisted world*...

# HOW would we adapt the gist of the vibe coding paradigm to open source engineering of infrastructure soluionware?**

*So, what is ***vibe engineering*** anyway?*

Vibe engineering could be thought of as an AI-assisted mental combination of [dialectical bootstrapping](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02271.x) with entire frameworks of frameworks, eg think in terms of the Python ecosystem and maybe 40 other similar tool ecoystems/areas of patents on topic of that ... resulting dialetical kaliedoscopic storm akin to the old Russian TRIZ/ARIZ theory of inventive problem-solving. 

In essence, vibe engineering is about accelerated the negotiations implicit in the contemplation of the results from kaleidoscopic ideation ... breaking through the doors of perception doesn't have to be like dropping acid ... it could be thought as being similar to struggling with a problem and then *just sleeping on it* OR giving a writing assignment your best try and then *letting it go cold and coming back to it later with a fresh pair of eyes* OR asking a different audience with radically different starting assumptions to consider your idea OR rather than being stuck on one's own work or the IKEA effect in assembling furniture, instead looking at the global competitive marketplace for hundreds or thousands of better ideas.

### In NUTSHELL, the *vibe engineering* process involves:

#### Problem Formulation For The Kaliedoscopic TRIZ/ARIZ Of AI

Begin by just talking it out ... defining the problem using TRIZ/ARIZ methodology, is basically a spin on Minimal Viable Prototype (MVP) methodology, identifying the primary technical contradiction (e.g., increasing users worsens performance) and the Ideal Final Result (e.g., handling any number of users without degradation). This step ensures clarity and aligns with engineering problem-solving formats, as suggested by the user’s emphasis on concrete, quantifiable objectives.

#### Initial Solution Generation

Use TRIZ tools like the contradiction matrix and inventive principles to generate initial solution ideas. For example, for scalability issues, principles like "Parameter Change" (e.g., dynamic scaling) or "Segmentation" (e.g., distributing load) could be applied, as seen in software-specific TRIZ applications (TRIZ for software architecture - ScienceDirect).

#### Incorporating Dialectical Bootstrapping

Encourage contributors to adopt multiple perspectives in their own MVP brainstorming, either individually or as a group. Individually, this means generating conflicting opinions and averaging or in picking the best parts of each of them, as in dialectical bootstrapping. In a group setting, different contributors, as in crowdsourcing, can provide wildly divergent unique viewpoints on what they see as an MVP scenario. 

#### Integration and Synthesis

Collect all proposed MVP solutions and use TRIZ tools to identify and resolve contradictions. For example, if one solution increases server resources and another optimizes code, integrate them by prioritizing based on cost and effectiveness. The user’s 25-step meta-algorithm, such as performing ideality analysis and applying Su-Field analysis, provides a detailed framework for this integration, ensuring a hybrid MVP solution that leverages the best elements.

#### Iterative Refinement and AI Assistance:

Use iterative TRIZ/MVP methods like the 9-windows approach to consider the problem at different levels (component, system, user experience) and time frames (current, future). AI can assist by summarizing discussions, identifying patterns, and suggesting TRIZ principles, enhancing efficiency in large, collaborative projects. This aligns with the user’s mention of AI-assisted creative problem-solving, potentially bordering on "hallucinations" for novel ideas.

#### Community Review and Validation

Present the integrated MVP solution to the open-source community for feedback, ensuring it aligns with project goals, maintainability, and open-source principles. This step addresses the collaborative nature of open-source development, where consensus and contribution management are crucial. The next phase is to launch the MVP prototype and get reactions from beta users/stakeholders.

### Challenges and Considerations

Adapting this approach faces challenges, particularly in coordinating diverse contributors and ensuring feasibility in open-source settings. The complexity of TRIZ, requires tailoring and outside-the-box thinkering. TRIZ is about jamming, free of psychological inertia ... removing tradition-bound arbitrary limits on the solution space, necessitating techniques like provocation and analogies from distant domains to challenge assumptions ... this ideation process is CONFRONTATIONAL, ie everyone's pet idea and sacred cow will be slaughtered ... that's why it's so necessary to be free of HATE, free of FEAR.

To overcome these, we try to use the available free communication tools ... as best we can ... we might start with a GitHub based workflow for managing repositories in the organization, using issue tracking systems to organize tasks, hold regular meetings for engagement, and develop vibe engineering resources.  AI tools and things like AI-first IDEs can AI-ify processes and also help to automate the brute-force computation-heavy parts of the process ... but it still comes down to doing disciplined HARD engineering. That challenge does not go away with AI or vibe engineering, the nature of the task changes.

## More Detailed Steps Of Dialectical Bootstrapping With TRIZ/ARIZ

### 0. Understanding the Gist of The Vibe Engineering Meta-Algorithm

- Vibe engineering is HARD engineering ... it's Human-In-Loop AI-assisted engineering, not really about some magic AI easy button ... it's about using AI as a tool and adopting a meta-cognitive mindset ... controlling your mind AND controlling the AI ... in order to do AI-assisted engineering ... it's not about wild hallucinations and coloring outside the lines, throwing mud in the direction of where you think the wall is in order see if somehow some of your mud might stick to something ... the more that you really UNDERSTAND about how things work, the better that your prompt to the system is going to generate actionable results, which provide the basis for better UNDERSTANDING the *big picture*, thinkering with resulting ideas and then asking better questions 

- Get your mind right ... purify your vibe .. *love*, groove, exercise, loosen up, forgive, drive out fear, eliminate hate, don't rely on external stimulants/atmosphere/music, control your mind, get rid of unhelpful, negative buzzkill vibes as they arise. Be childlike in your joy, excitement and infectious exuberance of HARD ENGINEERING.

- In order to optimize the ASSIST offered by LLM AI, you will succeed most rapidly by understanding the algorithms ... but you never understand as much as you can learn from your next AI-assisted engineering session ... there will always be more to learn and master.

- Articulate your prompts in terms of concrete, quantifiable, realistic objectives; your prompts are like code that should make sense to you when you come back to them after forgetting that you wrote them -- it's like good engineering problem-solving format. 

- Become a student of new developments in meta-cognition topics like dialectical bootstrapping, ARIZ/TRIZ at Level 5 of 6 of Bloom's Taxonomy or ideally at a level which you could publish in peer-reviewed engineering / scientific journals.
