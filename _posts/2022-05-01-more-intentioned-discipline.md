The title is REPETITIVE ... but, if anything, it level of [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) probably is not deeply recursive enough.

The best solutions from difficult problems will come from how we THINK ... that's not how one side or the other thinks; it's not about compromise; it's definitely not going to be found in machine learning or some sort of algorithm that *fairly* weights whose thinking should carry more weight ... the best solutions will come from a messy, protracted, violent, aggravating and necessarily difficult battle over time in how we think.  

The battle will prove to be more complex and exhausting and inconclusive than anyone can imagine ... when the problem is sufficiently difficult the differences in thinking will probably result in violence and war ... and that is how it HAS TO GO in difficult problems.

It ridiculously EASY to censor one side or to ridicule a side's arguments or slander certain proponents ... but censoring, ridiculing and cheap slanderous shots NEVER EVER EVER EVER win wars, ie those stupid hateful tactics do not other than just deepen resolve ... and it is resolve, regardless of how resolve arises, which helps lead to the RECURSIVELY-intentioned discipline which does wins wars.

That is why we say ... the solutions to difficult problems will be necessarily complex and cognitively DIFFERENT, but mostly they are about the sustained long-term application of collaborative, multi-dimensional hybrid intelligence and the deeply recursively-intentioned improvement of discipline.
