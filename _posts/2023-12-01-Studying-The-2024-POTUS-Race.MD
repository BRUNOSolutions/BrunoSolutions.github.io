# Shift Left ... Not Politically ... But in Time

Stop looking in the rear view mirror ... THINK about the Journey ahead. 

It's already time to start cutting up the carcasses and do the POST-mortem autopsy on the failed candidacies of 2024.

## What does not work and why

The race for 2024 started in December 2020, right after the Electoral College convened and the state legislatures certified the electors ... RIGHT THEN, back in 2020 is when the race for the 2024 kicked off IN EARNEST ... of course, we know from history, that candidates have to have a pathologically level of ambition for the Oval office and they must aspire ***serioiusly*** to prepare their lives to be ready for the Presidency from their youth -- we're not talking about THAT ... what we are talking about is the organizational groundwork that preceeds serious, every day campaigning by the earliest advance teams ... THAT is the part of the ***campaign*** for 2024 started in December 2020 ... the Trump campaign is really the only campaign that came close to realizing this and started [somewhat incoherently at first] putting together the Trump 2024 organization with officials working the early states immediately, or at least right after January 6 ... nobody else [who could entertain serious aspirations to be POTUS] started soon enough.

So ... to candidates like Doug Burgum ... WHY in the world would you wait to put together a skeletal staff until 2023 to kick off your campaign for the POTUS race in 2024? If you were going to run ... WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE YOU WAITING FOR?

By election night of Novemer, 2022, you should have already a minimally-staffed campaign organization in place that had already played a role in electing your political allies in the 2022 elections.  

Shift LEFT means that campaign starts WAY EARLIER ... in practice, this means, you should have had the intell gathering operation in place in 2021 ... a concrete organization of PAID staffers who believed in your campaign -- not just some informal phone calls, but PAID staff [low-cost but dedicated staff, working out of their den at home OR mom&dad's basement] ... a concrete organization which would help you to play a role at early level fundraising activities and the like that were all about electing the next generation of political leaders, new candidates running for Legislature, Attorney General and Secretary of State and Governor in  the key states of the 2024 race ... 

Leadership involves ambition and vision ... personal foresight ... why is it necessary to remind candidates why YOU NEED TO DIG YOUR WELL BEFORE YOU ARE THIRSTY?

Start EARLIER ... if you are thinking about the race for 2028 ... you need to start NOW ... or, actually, you should have started earlier because you are already behind ... but the past is the past ... you can't change that ... we don't drive by looking in the rear view mirror; we drive by looking forward.  

# 2024 is for STUDYING How to Best Run for POTUS in 2028

Let's start thinking about some of the key dates ... there will be lots of opportunities to learn, but PRACTICALLY speaking ... the 2024 race is basically already over ... opinion leaders have already pretty much made up their minds about how they see things working out ... it's too late to build a campaign organization for 2024, but it's not too late to start building that skeletal campaign organization for 2028 ... study what is working, who the fresh faced rising future stars ... start locking up the talent that your campaign will need to be successful as it puts together its PAID team in December 2024 ... you should have started before for 2028, but you can start now.

## Start brainstorming about the key points of your 2028 campaign NOW

FORK this repo ... populate your OWN list of 200 brainstormed ideas, but CAPTURE those ideas right now ... segment those ideas into the following categories ... A) Actionable right now, B) Actionable with funding, C) Actionable, in case you have more funding than you know what to do with, D) Parking lot, wild hair ideas that need more development 

1) People, organization, staffing, volunteers ... WHO is going to BELIEVE in your 2028 campaign enough to work insane hours for a minimal earnest money commitment in salary ... don't expect GOOD people put their life on hold and go into debt for YOUR campaign ... you will need to have a plan to pay them *something* or cover their expenses ... but exactly WHO are these people in states like Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina ... exactly WHO are these people that are going to start electing your political allies in your national "overnight success" organization.

2) What do you know about social media, interactions, DMs ... how can you deliver content that promotes your ability to be seen as thought leader and Presidential candidate in 2028 ... it's not just Twitter, Medium, LinkedIn, Substack, et al ... it also includes the use of SMM tools like Hootsuite, Buffer, CloudCampaign, etc.

2) What do you know about analytics, experimentation, optimization to drive engagement ... including the use of tools like Google Analytics, Google Optimize, [Google Tag Manager](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6102821?hl=en), etc.

3) Not just ZOOM or Twitter Spaces ... what do you know about Zulip or Slack to engage your paid staff as well as your unpaid staff of early volunteers?  How will you use these tools to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

4) What do you know about ConstantContact, MailChimp, SendGrid, etc. ... how will you use these tools to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

5) What do you know about AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. ... how will you use these tools to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

6) What do you know about guerilla advertising, monetization, patronage ... fundraising for the sake of more fundraising to support your campaign ... we cannot stress it enough, exactly HOW will you use these tools to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

7) What's your CRM game look like ... what do you know about the use of tools like [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/) to build a community of supporters and volunteers TO ELECT YOUR POLITICAL ALLIES TO OFFICE IN 2026?

8) WHO are the political allies in different key states that you want to elect? How are you going to find these people? How are you going to support them? How are you going to help them to win their elections? How are you going to help them to help you to win your election?
