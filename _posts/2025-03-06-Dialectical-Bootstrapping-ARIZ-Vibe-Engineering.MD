The software development community is buzzing about *'vibe coding,'* a trend where developers use AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to generate code from high-level descriptions. This approach is celebrated for its efficiency in creating simple applications and UI designs, enhancing productivity. Of course, there's skepticism regarding vibe coding effectiveness for complex software projects, where traditional coding skills like system architecture understanding and manual debugging are still deemed essential ... but the early examples are promising. For example, the release of Windsurf Wave 4, with features like Previews and Cascade Auto-Linter, supports this new coding paradigm by facilitating quick UI adjustments and maintaining code quality. 

# HOW would we adapt the gist of the vibe coding paradigm to open source engineering of infrastructure soluionware?

Vibe engineering could be thought of as an AI-assisted mental combination of [dialectical bootstrapping](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02271.x) with the Russian TRIZ/ARIZ theory of inventive problem-solving. In essence, these approaches could be thought as being similar to struggling with a problem and then *just sleeping on it* OR giving a writing assignment your best try and then *letting it go cold and coming back to it later with a fresh pair of eyes* OR asking a different audience with radically different starting assumptions to consider your idea OR rather than being stuck on one's own work or the IKEA effect in assembling furniture, instead looking at the global competitive marketplace for hundreds or thousands of better ideas.

The point of either TRIZ/ARIZ or AI-assisted dialectical idea synthesis is to radically increase the combinations of *pretty good* ideas using AI as a sieve or sorting mechanisms.

The point is to smash through cognitive limitations with a framework that ideates the generation of what are mostly likely to be the seeds of better solutions ... dialectical bootstrapping with the Russian TRIZ/ARIZ theory of inventive problem-solving work through very different mechanism or thought processes, but they are tangentially-related in that the different ideation mechanisms are looking for solutions to the same problem [or closely related problems]. 

TRIZ provides structured patterns of innovation and contradiction resolution, while dialectical bootstrapping leverages cognitive diversity within a single mind [or the single mind of the prompt engineer]. 

It is **together**, by adding the power of AI-assisted creative problem-solving [almost bordering on hallucinations], in *vibe engineering* that these approaches help us create a powerful meta-algorithm for problem-solving. What follows are are 25 key steps for applying dialectical bootstrapping to enhance TRIZ/ARIZ problem-solving ... or the AI-assisted vibe engineering meta algorithm.

## Dialectical Bootstrapping + TRIZ/ARIZ: Vibe Engineering Meta-Algorithm

### 1. Formulate the initial problem statement using standard TRIZ methodology
- Identify the primary technical or physical contradiction
- Define the ideal final result (IFR)
- Specify available resources and constraints
- Document your current mental model and assumptions

### 2. Generate your first solution approach using traditional TRIZ contradiction matrix
- Identify the improving and worsening parameters in the contradiction matrix
- Select the most promising inventive principles suggested by the matrix
- Apply these principles to develop initial solution concepts
- Document your reasoning path and selection criteria

### 3. Deliberately shift perspective by adopting an opposing worldview
- Choose a perspective fundamentally different from your default thinking (e.g., different discipline, industry, or cultural viewpoint)
- Temporarily adopt beliefs that contradict your usual assumptions
- Consider stakeholders with opposing interests to your primary consideration
- Document this alternative mental model explicitly

### 4. Reformulate the problem statement from this new perspective
- Redefine the primary contradiction using terminology from the new perspective
- Reframe the ideal final result through this alternative lens
- Identify different resources and constraints visible from this viewpoint
- Compare how the problem's importance and urgency differ in this framing

### 5. Apply TRIZ principles again from this alternative viewpoint
- Identify potentially different improving/worsening parameters from this perspective
- Select inventive principles that might not have been chosen initially
- Apply these principles with the alternative mindset
- Document how your solution path differs from the first iteration

### 6. Identify the contradictions between your two solution approaches
- Map explicit conflicts where solutions contradict each other
- Identify implicit assumptions that differ between approaches
- Note resource allocation differences between solutions
- Formulate these meta-contradictions in standard TRIZ format

### 7. Use these new contradictions as inputs for another round of TRIZ analysis
- Apply the contradiction matrix to these meta-contradictions
- Identify principles that could resolve conflicts between solutions
- Look for patterns in the suggested principles across all iterations
- Develop integrative concepts that address these higher-order contradictions

### 8. Perform an ideality analysis on both solutions
- Calculate the ideality ratio for each solution (benefits/(costs+harms))
- Identify the unique beneficial functions in each approach
- Map how each solution handles harmful functions differently
- Create a combined ideality assessment matrix

### 9. Create a hybrid solution integrating highest-value elements
- Rank elements from both solutions by their ideality contribution
- Identify synergistic combinations of elements across solutions
- Resolve integration conflicts using TRIZ principles
- Test the hybrid for unexpected emergent properties or conflicts

### 10. Apply Su-Field analysis to both solutions
- Create substance-field models for each solution approach
- Identify different resources utilized in each model
- Note differences in interaction types (harmful, insufficient, excessive)
- Map the complete field structure differences

### 11. Integrate the complementary resources identified
- Create a unified resource pool from both approaches
- Identify novel resource interactions possible with the combined pool
- Apply standard Su-Field transformations to the expanded model
- Develop resource-optimized hybrid solutions

### 12. Use the 9-windows thinking tool from different perspectives
- Complete the 9-windows grid from your original perspective
- Complete a second 9-windows grid from your alternative perspective
- Compare differences in system boundaries and hierarchies
- Identify integration opportunities across time and system levels

### 13. Map the psychological inertia revealed by comparing approaches
- Identify terminology differences that suggest conceptual biases
- Note scope limitations common to both approaches
- Identify domain-specific assumptions that limit solution space
- Document emotional or intuitive preferences in each approach

### 14. Systematically eliminate psychological inertia
- Apply provocation techniques to assumptions found in both approaches
- Use analogies from distant domains to challenge shared limitations
- Reframe the problem in language free from discipline-specific jargon
- Temporarily adopt impossible or absurd constraints to force novel thinking

### 15. Apply "smart little people" modeling from different perspectives
- Create a micro-level model using entities from your original domain
- Develop a second model using entities from your alternative perspective
- Analyze different interaction patterns between the models
- Identify novel functions visible only at the micro-level

### 16. Integrate the insights from both sets of modeling
- Create a unified micro-model incorporating elements from both approaches
- Translate micro-level insights back to macro-level solutions
- Identify emergent properties from the combined modeling
- Develop implementation concepts based on the integrated model

### 17. Apply ARIZ algorithm with your original mindset

- Document decision points and selection criteria
- Note where psychological inertia appears in your analysis
- Identify resource limitations in your approach

### 18. Restart ARIZ with your alternative mindset
