*PATIENCE, please ... this post is under the early, early pre-thinkering stages of construction*

## 100 Days of Podcastering

The *project car* will be a **#100DaysOf______** podcast at Bruno.Science. I joke about calling it a *project car*, because have sorta *dabbled* in the matter of podcastering before ... not really one bit serious ... Bruno.Science will ***still*** be dabbling. Dabbling 2.0. Podcastering is an example of something that I *should* learn ... it's not something that I see as a **need** to learn.

The WHY for "should learn podcastering" is that it's good add-on skill that really helps communicate and LISTEN more carefully ... it's like Toastmasters or practicing the skills in public speaking in front of an audience ... a secondary or more accurately a tertiary skill which can complement or enhance my primary or secondary skills in several different dimensions.

## Bruno.Science is the SCIENCE of #100Days0f_______

I am not especially interested in being followed by others ... well, at first, that may change on the SECOND #100DaysOf_____.

I am just doing the **100DaysOfPodcastering** series for my OWN use. It is only a *project car* for my own self-development ... maybe something to build on; maybe not ... if this goes well, it may turn into a better template for a series of **#100DaysOf______** podcasts at Bruno.Science.

## The Template for #100DaysOf________ 

1) Podcastering 2.0 ***starts*** with collaboraton and collaborative environments -- GitHub [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview#what-is-a-codespace) ... we are not recreating another podcast that we already like ... we are doing this to learn release 2.0, of where we see the realm of podcastering fitting in to our particular purposes. To reiterate, we are not doing this to creeate the podcast we wanted to listen to in the past. By the time you come across this, 2022 will be at least half-way into the rear-view mirror ... this is for maybe 2025 and beyond ... we believe that the whole process of creating content is going to be significantly MORE transparent than anything from Podcastering 1.0 you are seeing now. In the future, we believe that we will collaboratively develop an agenda to talk about [in some sort of collaborative environment that is browser-based or OS-independent] before we record the podcast to talk about the items and content repositories on that agenda.

2) Before we jump in, let's get an quick idea of what we are jumping into ... [examine the gist of how collaborative Codespaces are used for five minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) ... it's not JUST Codespaces ... we think that this is the general direction for all things creative ... of course, we will also talk about OTHER competing environments ... but to get started we will look at GitHub's Codespaces ... laying the foundation of the collaborative environment for content creation and revision will carry over for the first 20 podcasts.
