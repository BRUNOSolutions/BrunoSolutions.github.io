*PATIENCE, please ... this post is under the early, early pre-thinkering stages of construction*

On June 1, 2022 ... I decided that I will jump off the into deep end of the shallow pool with **100 Days of Podcastering**

The project car for this rebuild will be my podcast at Bruno.Science.

Right now, I envision that it will set out to be something akin to the RedGreenShow of the Whole Manliness genre of podcasts.

Those other Manliness shows in the "For Fellars Only *and Including Manly Lady Fellars [to be PC and all inclusivey]*" ... Bruno.Science will not be something that is all that funny except possibly in an intentenionally unintentional way which I didn't really plan... mostly, it's about how idiotic stubbornness can beat genuine toughness  ... in a small way, it might be about legit discipline-building.

I have sorta *dabbled* in the matter of podcastering before ... not really one bit serious at all, ie basically used the Anchor.FM app to record some private rants ...  not exactly something that I shared, except with a few very close friends ... basically the effort was sorta bound to fail ... because, from the start, it was just sort of dabbling with the app, ie not something that was planned or visualized with any kind of intention. It was unadulterated dabbling ... and there's nothing wrong with dabbling as long as every knows it's just dabbling.

Bruno.Science will still be dabbling. Dabbling 2.0.


I am not exactly sure that 100 days of Podcastering will change that. Somethings will change a bit, eg a tad more structure and less extemporaniety.

The real inadequacy or predisposition to failure in all things comes down to a lack of serious, ie with a degree intell gathering and analysis to see if one will get killed just doing something stupid, but serious INTENTION ... this lack of intention begins before the beginning  ... in the case of podcastering, I had not bothered to DEFINE or SCOPE or DOODLE or somehow sketch out on the back of napkin anything about my intention ... I didn't have even a clue about the precise WHY of WHY I should do it.

Podcastering is an example of something that I "should" learn ... it's not something that I see as a "need" to learn ... hopefully, it's clear what a "NEED to learn" is, but it's something that you will HAVE TO have learned in order to accomplish your life's mission ... "should learns" are things that one really SHOULD learn because these skills are going to support the NEEDED skills and greatly enhance the overall likelihood of success... whereas "NICE to LEARN" is making the best use of your time on a flight by reading a book or maybe learning a new topic in nanoscale imaging and practicing your scientific/engineering Russian with a Russian speaker.

My WHY for "should learn podcastering" is that it's good add-on skill that really helps communicate and LISTEN more carefully ... it's like Toastmasters or practicing the skills in public speaking in front of an audience ... a secondary or more accurately a tertiary skill which can complement or enhance my primary or secondary skills in several different dimensions.

I am not especially interested in being some sort of TimFerriss, JoeRogan or LexFridman, JockoWillink ... some iconic panthe-wearer in the pantheon of the Manliness genre of podcasts... I get the level of relentless intention that Tim/Joe/Lex/Jocko+Echo bring to the practice of the craft ... my level of interest is JUST in learning the skill well enough to be able to do it ...so it's like Toastmasters for me, ie I wanted to speak quasi-competently for thesake of people who were unfortunate to have to listen to me explain quantitative engineering analysis and data science. But it's still just Toastmasters -- I lack the personal WHY as a speaker to have a career as someone as inspiring, entertaining and professional as Steve Harvey, but [after Toastmasters] I appreciate Steve MUCH MORE ... of course, my Plimpton-esque foray into the world of world-class auctioneering helped, but I think that was a case of having too many agendas AND REALLY SIGNIFICANT HEALTH ISSUES.
