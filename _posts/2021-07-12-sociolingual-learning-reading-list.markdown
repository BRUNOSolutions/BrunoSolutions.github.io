# Introduction

How do HUMANS process language ...  it's a active, evolving sociocultural thing ... there are not really RULES that we understand or abide by when it comes to linguistics ... we don't take a class in the philosophy of Wittgenstein or how to argue correctly -- we just make up the methods/algorithms AS WE LEARN ... we do all kinds of stuff that the experts first think is wrong, like code switching, which later proves to be not just right but absolutely essential for the multilingual and sociolingual approaches to interpreting logic of human interaction. 

We are all multilingual in one respect or another ... we have our own jargon, terminology, cultural idioms ... we tell other people to "speak English" but our own langauge is completely foreign to English ... or to the English that a billion other English-speakers use ... we ALL live IN OUR OUR LITTLE WORLDS.

It might seem that there are common denominators ... as we know, for example, a set big tits have always helped men cross cultural barriers ... an inescapable motivation to go through the pain of learning a language and failing to be understood is a big part of why humans even bother ... learning to use a language well is damned hard; there are often other things to do that offer a bigger payoff.  

There might eventually be [or maybe already is] a much bigger demand for these different language training apps/businesses by a bigger, broader population ... probably needs to be more INTERACTIVE than Pimsleur tapes, Rosettta Stone programs or Duolingo online training ...  beyond listening, speaking with feedback, reading, writing, summarizing, describing, narrating with criticism, using idioms, cultural references, making jokes [even lame ones]  ... 

Then again, maybe not, because the need for the common ordinary person learning a language could obviated by things like more intelligent chatbots ... which gets into code, algorithms, computing horsepower, cloud compute and all that bs ... this was easier and more enjoyable when it was just about the big set of tits.  In other words ... big tits are kind of like a "GOTO statement" for a language learning program ... and EVERYBODY does it wrong.
