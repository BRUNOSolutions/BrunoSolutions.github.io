Study the recorded histories of all powers ... in ALL cases, you will find that better, leaner, more empathetic governments always come into power following either a revolution or after some collapse. 

Initially ... ***AS A RESULT OF THE COLLECTIVE WILL DISPLAYED BY THE REVOLUTION*** ... these brand new do governments represent a step forward.  

As we might expect, defenders of government are almost pathologically intent on claiming the post-revolution disruption in the old status quo as a benefit of government. The fact of the matter is that progress is possible ONLY THROUGH disruption and overthrow of old regimes. You might think that government can be refined, improved, re-focused by efforts to reduce government or return to a simpler state of affairs ... but that radically underestimates the entrench power of deeply embedded bureaucrats and their well-developed co-enabling rent-seeking constituencies.

Thus, the ONLY way for a step forward in government is by something that is so disruptive, so revolutionary that the majority of the respected voices from the sclerotocracy recoil in complete and total horror. THAT level of disruption is a sign that government is improving ... it will not be over ... the Party never ends, the road goes on forever.
