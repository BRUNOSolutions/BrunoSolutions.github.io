Study the recorded histories of all powers ... you will find that governments always come into power following either a revolution or after some collapse. Initially [AS A RESULT OF THE COLLECTIVE WILL DISPLAYED BY THE REVOLUTION] governments represent a step forward ... and defenders of government are almost pathologically intent on claim the post-revolution disruption in the old status quo as a benefit of government ... but the fact of the matter is that progress is possible ONLY THROUGH disruption and overthrow of old regimes.
