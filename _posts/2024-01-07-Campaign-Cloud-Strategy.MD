*We might think that we ultimately want to control our destiny with on-prem hardware BUT* ... gear gets expensive, even refurbed fifth string stuff from four or five years ago ... and realistically we're probably going to buy almost all the on-prem stuff from eBay or another refurbisher ... a serious home lab is enough ... why recreate one's own scientific high performance computing data center ...  so using the cloud is partly an exercise in developing specifications by seeing what has worked, what hasn't ... EXCEPT that mostly it's about trying stuff to see what works [and generates enough revenue to pay its bills].

## Cloud Strategy

We will try to look at the top ten ... and pick out the ONE to really focus on, although we might have two or three or four small lines in the water ... the **strategy is primarily an intelligence gathering strategy intended to be most useful for people who are looking at campaigns in 2028 and beyond.**

The strategy is really about gaining experience RATHER that acquiring gear.
