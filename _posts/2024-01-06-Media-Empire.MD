Your campaign ... because it is a campaign ... will need to become it's own *media empire* ... and your empire will need partners, sponsors and affiliates ... but first of all, your media empire will need a WRITTEN plan. 

## Strategy and business plan

STEP 1: Refine your blogging / book / MOOC / podcast *media empire* concept

STEP 2: Write down your the content production and promotion and analytics PLAN ... that's what *this OUTLINE* is ... the plan will need more details than this outtline, but at minimum, you will need to have well-defined material outline and plan of the expected frequency of content production and promotion. Your PLAN must evolve as you learn more your audience ... at first, YOU are going to be dogfooding your media -- in other words, YOU will the only audience you have ... but learning about the process and how the recorded material actually sounds/looks *up on stage* to you *back in the audience* is part of it. 

STEP 3: Choose the best hosting services ...  try several, but don't try too many ... it's important to get going with a couple that seem like a good fit ... but, at first, get going AND LEARN about the comparability of alternatives for your purposes!

STEP 4: Setup your content landing page on each host ... then retweak it tomorrow ... and the day after tomorrow ... for about a month ... then, after a month, you will have a better idea of what you want to do with it ... but, first of all, just get going with something raw for today ... and *fix it in production!*

STEP 5: Choose the best equipment to support your content, but KEEP IT EFFING SIMPLE ... do NOT get off into the weeds, in gear acquistion mode ... just go with cheapest thing that will possibly work ... invest in better gear AFTER you have a lengthy bit of experience, ie use what you have; the content revenues *should* pay for new gear.

STEP 6: Write up your material, rehearse what will be cover, then record the material

STEP 7: Edit/revise/rewrite your material with the applicable software, but don't be too much of a perfectionist at first ... just get the material out there and then refine it later ... it's better to get the material out there and then refine it later than to get bogged down in the details ... the time for perfectionism is LATER after you have some experience and maybe one or two followers ... at first, get going! 

STEP 8: Publish your first episode and promote it ... go back to your WRITTEN content production and promotion and analytics PLAN ... and keep revising that WRITTEN plan ...

STEP 9: Focus on your content publishing / media growth and analytics ... update your WRITTEN plan ... and invest more in better analytics and more complete data AS you get more experience and more followers ... but, at first, BASIC minimal level analytics will be fine ... FOR STARTERS,

STEP 10: Plan to make money with your *media empire* ... but TREAT IT AS A SERIOUS BUSINESS, pay attention to licensing and taxes and all that stuff ... but, at first, just generate some dollars ... go back to your WRITTEN content production and promotion and analytics BUSINESS PLAN ... and keep revising that written BUSINESS plan to FOLLOW THE MONEY.


## Partners and Sponsors

The blogging platforms keep getting better and better ... which is good, because blogging is tougher now than it was a couple decades ago ... and it will keep getting tougher ... because the content that is out there is top notch and it is next to impossible to get noticed ... you are going to need great partners and sponsors AND you are going to have keep your awareness of the industry and alternatives sharper than ever as you move forward ... the important point is that your strategy and business plan will have to adapt ... next month's plan will be different than this month's plan, but you will need to have constantly revised / updated WRITTEN plan or forward looking vision to move toward.
