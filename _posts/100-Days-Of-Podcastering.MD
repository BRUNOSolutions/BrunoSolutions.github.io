*PATIENCE, please ... this post is under the early thinkering stages of construction*

I have sorta *dabbled* in the matter of podcastering before ... not really serious at all; not something that I shared except with a few friends ... basically the effort was sorta bound to fail because, from the start, it was just sort of dabbling, ie not something that was planned or visualized with any kind of intention. It was dabbling ... and there's nothing wrong with dabbling as long as one knows it's just dabbling.

The real inadequacy or predisposition to failure is lack of INTENTION ... this lack of intention begins before the beginning  ... in the case of podcastering, I had not bothered to DEFINE or SCOPE or DOODLE or somehow sketch out on the back of napkin anything about my intention ... I didn't have even a clue about the precise WHY of WHY I should do it.

Podcastering is an example of something that I "should" learn ... it's not something that I see as a "need" to learn ... hopefully, it's clear what a "NEED to learn" is, but it's something that you will HAVE TO have learned in order to accomplish your life's mission ... "should learns" are things that one really SHOULD learn because these skills are going to support the NEEDED skills and greatly enhance the overall likelihood of success... whereas "NICE to LEARN" is making the best use of your time on a flight by reading a book or maybe learning a new topic in nanoscale imaging and practicing your scientific/engineering Russian with a Russian speaker.

My WHY for "should learn podcastering" is that it's good add-on skill that really helps communicate and LISTEN more carefully ... it's like Toastmasters or practicing the skills in public speaking in front of an audience ... a secondary or more accurately a tertiary skill which can complement or enhance my primary or secondary skills in several different dimensions.

I am not especially interested in being some sort of TimFerriss, JoeRogan or LexFridman, JockoWillink ... some iconic panthe-wearer in the pantheon of the Manliness genre of podcasts... I get the level of relentless intention that Tim/Joe/Lex/Jocko+Echo bring to the practice of the craft ... my level of interest is JUST in learning the skill well enough to be able to do it ...so it's like Toastmasters for me, ie I want to speak competently [for thesake of people who have to listen to me explain quantitative engineering analysis and data science -- I may lack the personal WHY as a speaker to have a career as someone as inspiring, entertaining and professional as Steve Harvey, but I appreciate Steve more more after being in Toastmasters and my Plimpton-esque foray into the world of world-class auctioneering.

So I decided to do 100 Days of Podcastering ... the project car for this rebuild will be Bruno.Solutions ... which will set out to be something akin to the RedGreenShow of the Whole Manliness genre of podcasts; those other Manliness shows in the "For Fellars Only [Including Manly Lady Fellars [to be PC and all inclusivey]" ... not something that is funny except possibly in an intentenionally unintentional way ... mostly it's about idiotic conservativism and stubbornness vs genuine toughness and legit discipline-buildings.
