Discipline equals freedom. It's about changing your habits to change yourself; the most important enabling habit which makes other improvements easier is a commitment to minimalism.

Open source is about extending the infrastructure and tools that we use to help us analyze data to extend knowledge and Science ... it is also philosophically about much deeper levels of intellectual freedom and the freedom of exchange or networking between human beings.

Voluntarism is about understanding the will and controlling the programming that is being used to control people's choices of what they imagine they want and what they spend their lives doing.
