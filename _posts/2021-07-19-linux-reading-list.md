Those who don't bother to understand the philosophy and culture of programming in the profitable Linux environment will necessarily attempt to repeat it, clumsily, inefficiently, horribly. 

It's not really Unix and elite Unix distributions which have change the world ... it's Linux, Linux distros, Linux package managers and Linux content marketing of predominantly for-profit open source business.

One of the consequences of the exponential power-vs-time curve in computing [which has been amplified by cloud-computing resources available at scale to anyone with a credit card] is that noobs can reinvent automated new serverless frameworks and new interfaces like notebooks which run in containerized versions of the Unix environment spawned effortlessly inside of containers inside of other containers while everthing is monitored by a dashbord collecting data that has been analyzed in other containers. 

The thing for open sourceists to pay attention to is that success acrues to those who remove the most barriers for the most people ... open source is not really any differnt than commerce ... first it was Sears, then K-Mart, then Walmart, then Amazon ... the scrappy, nasty, well-executing company that has given the best selection of products at the most affordable prices to the unwashed masses without the means or [geographic] access to great bricks-and-mortar shoping experiences has always been much more successful than the vendors that other people LOVE. It's the same in open source ... without the driven EXECUTION of a sponsoring entity [not an individual, because individuals have up-and-down years] ... without EXECUTION, open source sucks wind. 

## START by looking at the [Red Hat Developer Network](https://developers.redhat.com/topics/linux)

There are other places one could start ... we start with Red Had Developer Network because the success of Red Hat illustrates better than any other fork one wants to follow of what has become of the Linux attempt to make Unix available for the billions ... this is NOT an argument for getting the RHCA certification or [downloading RHEL](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download/) or investing in IBM because of its [most important asset, IBM's RedHat subsidiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat). Nobody needs to make the case that the company can make well enough itself.

This is about what determines success in open source ... we define "success" as delivering the most VALUE for the most people. Value comes from information that changes the choice set that a person has. What has changed this choice set and then resulted in better bargain to rapidly change the game, economically/politically/culturally? 

What has done this more than Red Hat Linux ... in the mid 90s, it started off being about running the LAMP stack to power things like eBay or Amazon; more recently, it's about ephemeral but secure, well-architected, reliable machine images spun up inside containers somewhere running on another RH Linux machine [or extended from RHEL source] somewhere in the AWS/Azure/GCP/Alibaba/IBM/Oracle/on-prem cloud to serve information to someone with a mobile phone, tablet or chromebook. 

That kind of ubiquity is another facet that should be acknowledged about capitalism and how success comes from the long term execution of delivering on a better product and giving the marketplace an optimal choice. Ever since its beginnings, RedHat and Linux Journal have been more than capable in content marketing, listening to the needs of more demanding customers [with $ to spend] and making RHEL the defacto standard in business Linux ... so Redhat is just another lesson about who makes History, who gets to writes History and supply clueless journos with content, who is financially successful enough to inspire the envy that eggs on a counter-revolutionary movement, eg [SoftwareInThePublicInterest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_in_the_Public_Interest) and promoters of Debian, because people always want a choice when it comes to movements.

Until Linux and the Redhat and Debian distros and then the [.rpm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager) and [.deb] [approaches to package management](https://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=package-management) came along, Unix was really a extremely small, cliquey, exclusive quasi-private set of small clubs that effectively barred entry to anyone who didn't have a job at ATT's Bell Labs, IBM, HP, Sun, in government or at least something like a college sysadmin background ... people with this nerd-elite background might want to argue that they got their position on merit ... but the fact is that NOBODY else could afford machine that ran Unix or could pay for ATT/IBM/HP/Solaris UNIX license. There's nothing inherently malicious about the small population of comparatively-affluent nerd elite in 1991.  

It was a whole different ballgame after Linux, after Red Hat, after the package managers made open source accessible to the masses after 1996 ... no amount of religious fervor and bloviating about what FREE open source software is can compete with what capitalism delivers best, a MUCH LOWER BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR THE MASSES, ie not just affordability of a binary distro from the interwebs but the lack of prequisisite skills/hardware investments [or access to elite institutions] to produce something useful out of that distro.
