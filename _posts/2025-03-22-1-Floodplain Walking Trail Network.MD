#### Extreme TBD Warning

This is very much adhoc **To Be Determined** territory ... these are only five IDEAs for slightly more serious consideration  ...and a list of other brainstormed potentially implement-able approaches.

## Community Exercise and Fitness Improvement Programs for Floodplain Land

This is one of five PROPOSED approaches to transform FEMA-purchased floodplain properties from a maintenance burden into valuable community assets that use these proposed approach(s) to enhance physical fitness, ecological function, and community connection. By respecting the natural flood cycle and avoiding permanent structures, these programs create sustainable, resilient fitness opportunities while honoring the essential role of floodplains in watershed health.

The approaches, each with **no financial expenditure or Administrative resources from the City government**, utilize nothing but vacant FEMA floodplain land and volunteer labor from those who commit [with a suggested $50/yr donation to defray administrative expense] sign up to participate physically in making these social community fitness-betterment approaches work, are as follows:

1) [Walking Trail Network](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/1-Floodplain-Walking-Trail-Network.html) ... would establish a system of natural surface walking paths throughout FEMA-purchased floodplain properties, creating an interconnected network of trails that promote regular physical activity while respecting floodplain restrictions. This approach is based on successful models from communities in Vermont, North Carolina, and Iowa that have maintained floodplain trail systems for over 25 years.

2) [Fitness Equipment Circuit](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/2-Floodplain-Fitness-Equipment-Circuit.html) ... would create a distributed network of flood-resilient fitness stations throughout FEMA-purchased properties, connected by walking paths. All elements are designed to withstand or be easily removed before flooding events. This approach is based on successful models from flood-prone communities in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and parts of Australia that have maintained flood-adaptive fitness circuits for 15+ years.

3) [Field Sports Program](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/3-Floodplain-Field-Sports-Program.html) ... utilize FEMA-purchased properties as natural playing fields for various recreational activities requiring minimal permanent infrastructure. All equipment is portable and activities are designed to adapt to seasonal changes in the floodplain. This approach is modeled after successful programs in floodplain communities in Tennessee, Virginia, and parts of the Northeast operating for 20+ years.

4) [Foraging and Natural Movement Program](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/4-Floodplain-Foraging-and-Natural-Movement-Program.html) ... creates structured opportunities for physical activity through seasonal wild edible harvesting, natural movement, and ecological stewardship on FEMA-purchased floodplain properties. This approach combines nutrition education with varied physical activities while enhancing floodplain ecological function. The model is based on successful programs in river communities in Wisconsin, Oregon, and parts of New England that have operated sustainably for 20+ years.

5) [Cultural Heritage Fitness Trail](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/5-Cultural-Heritage-Fitness-Trail.html) ...creates a fitness program by connecting physical activity with the cultural and natural history of the floodplain through an interpretive trail system with associated activities. This approach is modeled after successful programs in river communities in Kentucky, South Carolina, and parts of the Midwest operating for 25+ years.

As noted, each of these approaches would be modeled upon something that have proven to be sustainable and successful in other communities of this size for decades. We can learn from these examples of what has worked and also avoid what has not worked.

There is no implied priority in this ordering of five. Each of the proposed approaches could be implemented individually OR multiples may be combined into ONE integrated system utilizing different sections of the floodplain for complementary activities. All five approaches emphasize volunteer leadership, minimal infrastructure, and adaptation to natural cycles, ensuring long-term sustainability with minimal ongoing costs.



The specific approach examined in this document is the first one.

## Floodplain Walking Trail Network

### Operations Management Summary

**Program Overview:**
The Floodplain Walking Trail Network establishes a system of natural surface walking paths throughout FEMA-purchased floodplain properties, creating an interconnected network of trails that promote regular physical activity while respecting floodplain restrictions. This approach is based on successful models from communities in Vermont, North Carolina, and Iowa that have maintained floodplain trail systems for over 25 years.

**Core Components:**
- Natural surface trail system designed to withstand periodic flooding
- Volunteer-led walking groups meeting throughout the week
- Seasonal trail maintenance activities doubling as fitness opportunities
- Interpretive elements highlighting flood ecology and resilience
- Mobile trail markers that can be easily removed before flood events
- Community mapping and trail stewardship program

**Volunteer Structure:**
- Trail Network Coordinator (1 volunteer): Oversees entire program
- Zone Stewards (4-6 volunteers): Monitor and coordinate maintenance for trail sections
- Walk Leaders (10-15 volunteers): Facilitate regular walking groups
- Naturalist Team (3-5 volunteers): Develop educational elements for trails
- Flood Response Team (5-7 volunteers): Coordinate pre/post flooding protocols

**Resource Requirements:**
- Minimal infrastructure (natural surface trails, removable markers)
- Basic trail maintenance tools (stored off-site)
- Mobile interpretive materials
- Digital and printed trail maps
- Weather alert system
- First aid kits for walk leaders

**Implementation Timeline:**
1. **Month 1-2**: Map existing access points and potential trail corridors
2. **Month 3-4**: Establish initial trail sections with minimal clearing
3. **Month 5**: Train volunteer walk leaders and zone stewards
4. **Month 6-7**: Launch initial walking groups on established trails
5. **Month 8-9**: Develop interpretive elements and expanded trail sections
6. **Month 10-12**: Conduct first seasonal trail maintenance event, evaluate program

**Sustainability Mechanisms:**
- Resilient design accommodating natural flood cycles
- Regular volunteer trail stewardship activities
- Seasonal trail condition assessment and adaptation
- Flood response protocols protecting trail infrastructure
- Integration with community emergency management planning

**Measured Outcomes:**
- Trail usage metrics (aim for 15% of population in first year)
- Volunteer participation in maintenance activities
- Participant self-reported health improvements
- Ecological improvements in floodplain areas
- Community knowledge of floodplain function

### Project Implementation Summary

**Trail System Design:**
- Conduct comprehensive mapping of FEMA properties
- Identify optimal trail corridors respecting natural hydrology
- Design trail system minimizing environmental impact
