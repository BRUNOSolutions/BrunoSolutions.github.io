**Vibe Engineering** is somewhat like '[***vibe coding***](https://gemini.google.com/app/e3a900f51f6a920e),' but perhaps, we could say that it's more about requirements elicitation and requirement management, rather than understanding use cases and using programming language constructs. Thus, *[vibe engineering](https://x.com/i/grok/share/kVArubk3OD0h2ZfETGqYxibBp)* will in the fashion of [***vibe coding***](https://gemini.google.com/app/e3a900f51f6a920e)aim at using automation and AI to rapidly overcome the tedium of understanding the full regulatory landscape, something about the multi-disciplinary technologies, and the roadmap for implementation and scope mgmt. 

In order to start thinking about *[vibe engineering](https://x.com/i/grok/share/kVArubk3OD0h2ZfETGqYxibBp)* ... maybe as [framework for developing other vibe tools](https://medium.com/intuitionmachine/a-framework-for-developing-vibe-ai-tools-d663971e3a9b) ... with a *vibe layer* for capturing the high-level feel or intent, a natural language conversation chat and more structured prompt layer to enable an efficient back-and-forth dialogue with AI, a domain Knowledge and constraint layer to integrate domain-specific rules, heuristics, or best practices and collaboration and refinement layer to facilitate iterative, co-creative workflows with versioning, branching, and user overrides, or maybe ... we need to take step back to really *understand* what vibe coding [is about, why it has taken off, what makes it interesting] in very fundamental terms and [***contemplate even better frameworks***?](https://x.com/i/grok/share/OSF2aYfYc2TSXPshZxxp5xqJ8) such as a modular framework (Intent Capture, AI Engine, Domain Integrator, Feedback Loop, Output Layer, Context Manager) builds on that by adding flexibility and explicit context handling to structure the framework around guiding principles rather than components: 

1) Prioritize User Intent: Make expressing “what” effortless. 

2) Leverage AI Automation: Let AI sweat the details.

3) Incorporate Domain Expertise: Keep outputs practical.

4) Support Iterative Collaboration: Enable refinement and teamwork.

5) Maintain Contextual Awareness: Ground the process in history.

It is clear that we need more experience *thinkering* with these frameworks, but this does feel like it is some exciting material.

# Vibe Coding Is Fundamentally About Engagement ... Engagement Happens Because of rapid prototyping RESULTS

The software development community has been buzzing about the innately SOCIAL trend of '[***vibe coding***](https://gemini.google.com/app/e3a900f51f6a920e),' in which developers or maybe we should say hackers use AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), to generate code from high-level descriptions. This approach is celebrated for its efficiency in creating simple applications and UI designs, enhancing productivity. Of course, there's skepticism regarding vibe coding effectiveness for complex software projects, where traditional coding skills like system architecture understanding and manual debugging are still deemed essential. Vibe coding is inherently social coding or engagement with other hackers who are also prioritizing the feeling and social atmosphere of a hacker's digital interface. It's not only fun, but the early examples are promising. For example, the release of Windsurf Wave 4, with features like Previews and Cascade Auto-Linter, supports this new coding paradigm by facilitating quick UI adjustments and maintaining code quality. 

The key is **JUST DO IT!** That is, of course, what vibe coding or public infrastructure and community hacking are completely about. Of course, it's important to embrace the open-source ethos, prioritize ethical considerations, and foster a collaborative spirit to harness the power of Generative AI for personalized and accessible lifestyle advice ... but the key is just get started, make something, fail, learn as much as possible and iterate, but to **JUST DO IT!** 

# HOW would we adapt the gist of the vibe coding paradigm to open source infrastructure soluionware?

In order to start getting some practical experience with how this might work, we asked Grok3 to *vibe code* [an improved meta-design document for the process of developing a municipal wastewater treatment facility serving a community of 5,000-10,000 people in Northwest Iowa.](https://x.com/i/grok/share/frXKkdpW7kaskW9jAQN3BfmTc) 

In this post, we BEGIN TO explore our thinking in how vibe coding might be an incredibly important development in the realm of what BrunoSolutions is about, free open source public infrastructure solutionware.

### Key Points

- **Requirements engineering is HARD** -- And *mind-numbingly tedious*, so nobody does a good enough job of it -- *mostly, engineers just reach a point where they have been over the applicable specs to the point where they have gotten sick of it and, instead of a clean handoff, they do the best they can and throw the baton in the direction of the next runner.* It seems likely, well, in fact, it is pretty much gauranteed that engaging qualified engineering firms will absolutely need to be involved -- these firms REQUIRE [with abundantly good reason] clear, detailed, well-articulated design requirements based on this expanded plan to avoid open-ended inquiries. The FACT that government officials, both paid staff and elected officials, have close to zero ability to perform this articulation, results in engineering firms having to be retained to BEGIN the process of assisting governments in understanding what they need. 

- **Vibe Engineering Is Requirements Elicitation Tool** -- The evidence from the experience gained from vibe coding so far leans toward the enjoyable process of using AI, like large language models, to just THINK, explore alternatives, and embrace exponential, almost hallucinatory thinking.  ULTIMATELY, however tons and tons and tons of iterations are required ... AI helps with these iterations, but for "vibe coding" to efficiently generate detailed software, through traditional coding skills remain an essential requirement ... it will be like that with "vibe engineering" ... the awesome power of AI is for enabling the early requirements elicitation phase of a larger engineering effort to be more rapid, much less tedious, less filled with technical-meeting-drudgery, and, ultimately, even fun. *Who knew that sewage can be FUN?*

- **Requirements Engineering Specifications Should Look Ahead To The Design Phase** -- Developing a detailed engineering requirements specification for the wastewater treatment system involves expanding the meta-design *vibe coding* framework such as it is with specific design parameters and regulatory compliance, ie it's about practical realworld stuff, like sewage treatmment ins/outs for [high temperature treatments for fecal coliform bacteria](https://chemtech-us.com/water-test-came-back-positive-for-coliform-advice-on-how-to-combat-the-bacteria) RATHER than the finer points of code or bandwidth throughput for gaming code ... *there's a LOT of rapid* ***drinking-from-the-firehose*** *learning involved* and *vibe engineering* might make that *funner*.

- **Vibe Engineering Sets The Stage For Safer, Simpler, More Sustainable Regenerative Systems** - The plan probably has to includes integrating animal fecal wastetreatment streams or by-products of industry intended for human consumption ... this may adding complexity AT FIRST to food safety and regulatory compliance ... but in the very long term, ecologically-adapted, sustainable regenerative systems actually will/should simplify the current food safety, animal health and sewage treatment regulatory complexity significantly.

### Detailed Plan Development

The development of the plan on how to practically apply vibe engineering expands upon the provided meta-design framework, covering population and flow analysis, regulatory compliance, site assessment, treatment process selection, wetland system design, agricultural application, and implementation planning. Each phase includes specific design parameters and references to key regulations and expert sources.

**Population and Flow Analysis**: Calculate average daily flow at 100 gallons per person per day, peak daily flow at twice the average, and project population growth over 20 years at 2% annually, based on EPA Design Considerations for Wastewater Treatment and Iowa DNR Wastewater Design Standards.

***Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure adherence to the Clean Water Act, Iowa DNR standards, NPDES permits, and EPA guidelines for water reuse, referencing IDNR NPDES Rules and EPA Water Reuse Guidelines.

**Site Analyses (PLURAL)**: Examine the pluses/minuses of different sites. Using primarily VIRTUAL methods, conduct topographical surveys, soil analysis, and flood zone assessments, using USDA NRCS Web Soil Survey and Iowa DNR Floodplain Management.  When multiple sites have been virtually analyzed, a single site can be examined physically, in detail. ***If it's too difficult to obtain the data for virtual analyses first, this would suggest a need for upgrading of US/State data repositories ... because those data do already exist.***

**Treatment Process Selection:** Recommend Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs) for secondary treatment, with UV or chlorination for disinfection, based on EPA Wastewater Treatment Manuals.

**Engineered Wetland System:** Design with hydraulic loading rates of 10-50 gallons per day per square foot, retention time of 7-14 days, and vegetation like cattails, referencing EPA Constructed Wetlands Handbook.

**Agricultural Application**: Plan for non-atomized irrigation, like drip irrigation first; if that is impractical or far to costly, sprinkler irrigation can be considered, but the water carrying treated effluent should not turned into humid aerosols. Look at rotational grazing with tall fescue, and animal integration with food safety measures, using NRCS Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative and Iowa State University Pasture Management Guide.

### Engaging Engineering Firms

Avoid open-ended inquiries. Do the homework first before asking firms to:

- Provide detailed designs for each phase based on specified parameters (e.g., flow rates, retention times).

- Ensure compliance with cited regulations and guidelines.

- Include cost estimates and construction sequencing, referencing expert sources like Iowa State University Extension and Outreach (Iowa State University Extension and Outreach).

### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis for Wastewater Treatment System Design

This survey note provides an in-depth analysis of developing a detailed engineering plan for a municipal wastewater treatment facility in Northwest Iowa, serving 5,000 to 10,000 people, with integrated conventional treatment, engineered wetlands, and agricultural reuse for nutrient recovery, ultimately producing animal products for human consumption. The analysis expands the provided meta-design framework, ensuring clarity for engaging qualified engineering firms without open-ended inquiries, and leverages AI for "vibe coding" while acknowledging traditional engineering needs.

### Background and Context of Vibe Engineering

The meta-design document deliverable from the vibe engineering process is to KNOWLEDGABLY outling a high-level framework for the system, which includes conventional wastewater treatment followed by an engineered wetland system and agricultural reuse.  It is NOT a plan for how to design the system.

The general goal of this approach to infrastruction solutionware is to get people started thinking about creating a nutrient recovery pathway, with the unexpected detail of producing animal products for human consumption, adding complexity to food safety and regulatory compliance. Given the community's size and location, the design must account for Iowa's climate, soil conditions, and regulatory environment.

The concept of "vibe coding," using large language models (LLMs) for generating code from high-level descriptions, is noted for its efficiency in simple applications and UI designs, as seen with Windsurf Wave 4's features like Previews and Cascade Auto-Linter. However, skepticism exists for complex projects, where traditional coding skills, such as system architecture understanding and manual debugging, remain essential. This analysis aims to balance AI efficiency with engineering rigor, ensuring a detailed plan for engaging firms.

#### Phase 1: Initial Assessment and Regulatory Framework

This phase involves population and flow analysis, regulatory compliance assessment, and site analysis, each critical for defining the system's scope.

**Population and Flow Analysis**
To determine the service population, a demographic assessment is necessary, estimating an average of 7,500 people for design purposes, with a projected 2% annual growth over 20 years. This yields a design population of approximately 11,144, calculated as 7500 * (1.02)^20 ≈ 11,144, based on standard growth models. Wastewater generation is set at 100 gallons per person per day, aligning with EPA suggestions for design purposes (EPA Design Considerations for Wastewater Treatment).

**Design Flows:**
- Average daily flow (ADF): 11,144 * 100 = 1,114,400 gallons per day.
- Peak daily flow (PDF): 2 * ADF = 2,228,800 gallons per day, using a multiplier of 2 based on typical design standards.
- Peak hourly flow (PHF): 3 * (ADF / 24) ≈ 139,299 gallons per hour, though refined to 116,082 gallons per hour using a 2.5 multiplier for average hourly flow, ensuring accuracy.

These calculations are informed by Iowa DNR Wastewater Design Standards, which should be consulted to provide current, state-specific guidelines.

**Regulatory Compliance Assessment**

Compliance is crucial, involving multiple layers of regulation:

- Clean Water Act: Sets national standards for water quality, managed by the EPA.

- Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) Standards: Governs wastewater discharge and treatment, with specific rules under the Iowa Administrative Code, as seen in IDNR NPDES Rules.

- NPDES Permit Requirements: Required for discharging pollutants, with permits renewed every five years, as noted for the Iowa Great Lakes Sanitary District.

- County Health Department Regulations: May impose additional local requirements.

- EPA Guidelines for Water Reuse in Agriculture: Include standards for irrigation, ensuring safety for crops and livestock, detailed in EPA Water Reuse Guidelines.

- OTHER ... assume that there are OTHER stakeholders with regulatory requirements or equivalent.

Considering these requirements ensures the system at least attempts to meet health and environmental standards, particularly for agricultural reuse producing animal products.

**Site Analyses**

- First look at MULTIPLE sites, virtually. looking ahead to the kinds of factors that will be important in completing the full survey for the chosen site ... iteratings the meta-design considerations of various sites helps to avoid wasting time/money working on a site that will not work ... ultimately, it will necessary to choose the one specific site to focus upon.

**Site-specific data on the chosen site is essential**, including:

- Topographical Survey: Determine elevation and slope, assuming flat to gently sloping based on Northwest Iowa's typical conditions, using USDA NRCS Web Soil Survey.

- Soil Analysis: Evaluate types like Webster and Canisteo silt loams, testing for permeability and suitability for wetlands and irrigation, informed by regional data.

- Groundwater Characteristics: Assess water table depth, ensuring no contamination risks, referencing Iowa DNR Floodplain Management.
Flood Zone Assessment: Ensure the site is not in a floodplain, critical for system reliability.

- Land Availability: Need sufficient space for treatment plant, wetland (10-50 gallons per day per square foot loading rate), and agricultural application, considering climate data with 30-35 inches annual rainfall.

This phase sets the foundation for design, ensuring site-specific considerations are addressed.

#### Phase 2: Treatment Process Selection

This phase selects primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment processes, balancing cost, operation, and performance.

**Primary Treatment System Design Parameters**, standard processes include:

- Screening: Mechanical bar screens with 6mm openings to remove large solids.

- Grit Removal: Aerated grit chambers to settle heavy particles, preventing wear on downstream equipment.

- Primary Clarification: Detention time of 1.5 to 2 hours, with surface overflow rate of 1,000 gallons per day per square foot, based on EPA Wastewater Treatment Manuals.

- Sludge Management: Thickening and stabilization, compliant with EPA 503 regulations for biosolids.

**Secondary Treatment Options Analysis**, options include 

- activated sludge, 

- extended aeration, 

- SBRs, 

- oxidation ditches, and 

- moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs). 

For community of roughly 5000 people in size, SBRs might recommended due to flexibility and suitability, with:

- Cycle times for fill, react, settle, and decant, ensuring effective treatment.

- Mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) targets of 2,000-3,000 mg/L, informed by design standards.

- Alternatives like extended aeration or oxidation ditches were considered but may have higher energy costs, while MBBRs might be overkill, based on Iowa DNR Design Standards for Wastewater Treatment.

**Tertiary Treatment Requirements**

Tertiary treatment ensures water quality for reuse or discharge:

- Filtration: Needed to remove remaining solids, with specifications based on flow rates.

- Disinfection: UV system sizing or chlorination/dechlorination, with contact time calculations, ensuring pathogen reduction for agricultural reuse, referencing EPA guidelines.
- Nutrient Removal: Partial or complete, depending on discharge limits or reuse needs, with expected performance of 60-70% nitrogen and 30-50% phosphorus removal in wetlands.

This phase ensures treated water meets standards for downstream processes.

#### Phase 3: Engineered Wetland System

The wetland system follows conventional treatment, enhancing pollutant removal and supporting agricultural reuse.

**Design Parameters**

- Hydraulic Loading Rate (HLR): 10-50 gallons per day per square foot, based on EPA Constructed Wetlands Handbook, ensuring treatment capacity.

- Treatment Pond Configuration: Series of 3-5 ponds, first pond 4-6 ft deep (facultative), subsequent ponds 1-3 ft deep with emergent vegetation zones, for staged treatment.

- Wetland Cell Depth Profiles: Level side to side, with bottom slopes of 1-3% upstream for mine drainage, if applicable, and dikes at 2H:1V slopes.

- Retention Time: 7-14 days, varying seasonally, critical for pollutant removal.

- Seasonal Operation Adjustments: Manage water levels for plant growth, with controlled flooding to 6 inches for establishment, based on handbook guidelines.

**Ecological Components**

- Wetland Vegetation: Select species like cattails, bulrushes, and reeds, suitable for Iowa's climate, with dense stands critical for treatment, planting at 1-2 inches deep for tubers, using Iowa State University Extension and Outreach for local recommendations.

- Seasonal Adjustments: Adjust for evapotranspiration (70-80% of pan evaporation), with supplemental water if needed, based on water balance equations.

This system enhances treatment, supporting agricultural reuse with high nutrient removal rates, ie nutrients become dangerous pollutants when discharged into public waters.

#### Phase 4: Agricultural Application System

This phase designs the irrigation and pasture management for treated wastewater, integrating animals for nutrient recovery.
Irrigation System Design

Type: Drip. But if necessary, sprinkler system are an option. The option is chosen based on crop type (pasture vs. other crops), with pump station specifications for peak flow, and filtration to prevent clogging, informed by NRCS Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative. Drip systems run continuously, thus require much less flow, ie smaller pumps, and also do not produce atomized volatile aerosols.
