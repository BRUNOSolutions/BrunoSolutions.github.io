#### Extreme TBD Warning

This is very much adhoc **To Be Determined** territory ... these are only five IDEAs for slightly more serious consideration  ...and a list of other brainstormed potentially implement-able approaches.


## Community Exercise and Fitness Improvement Programs for Floodplain Land

This is one of five PROPOSED approaches to transform FEMA-purchased floodplain properties from a maintenance burden into valuable community assets that use these proposed approach(s) to enhance physical fitness, ecological function, and community connection. By respecting the natural flood cycle and avoiding permanent structures, these programs create sustainable, resilient fitness opportunities while honoring the essential role of floodplains in watershed health.

The approaches, each with **no financial expenditure or Administrative resources from the City government**, utilize nothing but vacant FEMA floodplain land and volunteer labor from those who commit [with a suggested $50/yr donation to defray administrative expense] sign up to participate physically in making these social community fitness-betterment approaches work, are as follows:

1) [Walking Trail Network](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/1-Floodplain-Walking-Trail-Network.html) ... would establish a system of natural surface walking paths throughout FEMA-purchased floodplain properties, creating an interconnected network of trails that promote regular physical activity while respecting floodplain restrictions. This approach is based on successful models from communities in Vermont, North Carolina, and Iowa that have maintained floodplain trail systems for over 25 years.

2) [Fitness Equipment Circuit](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/2-Floodplain-Fitness-Equipment-Circuit.html) ... would create a distributed network of flood-resilient fitness stations throughout FEMA-purchased properties, connected by walking paths. All elements are designed to withstand or be easily removed before flooding events. This approach is based on successful models from flood-prone communities in Missouri, Pennsylvania, and parts of Australia that have maintained flood-adaptive fitness circuits for 15+ years.

3) [Field Sports Program](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/3-Floodplain-Field-Sports-Program.html) ... utilize FEMA-purchased properties as natural playing fields for various recreational activities requiring minimal permanent infrastructure. All equipment is portable and activities are designed to adapt to seasonal changes in the floodplain. This approach is modeled after successful programs in floodplain communities in Tennessee, Virginia, and parts of the Northeast operating for 20+ years.

4) [Foraging and Natural Movement Program](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/4-Floodplain-Foraging-and-Natural-Movement-Program.html) ... creates structured opportunities for physical activity through seasonal wild edible harvesting, natural movement, and ecological stewardship on FEMA-purchased floodplain properties. This approach combines nutrition education with varied physical activities while enhancing floodplain ecological function. The model is based on successful programs in river communities in Wisconsin, Oregon, and parts of New England that have operated sustainably for 20+ years.

5) [Cultural Heritage Fitness Trail](https://brunosolutions.github.io/compassion/2025/03/22/5-Cultural-Heritage-Fitness-Trail.html) ...creates a fitness program by connecting physical activity with the cultural and natural history of the floodplain through an interpretive trail system with associated activities. This approach is modeled after successful programs in river communities in Kentucky, South Carolina, and parts of the Midwest operating for 25+ years.

As noted, each of these approaches would be modeled upon something that have proven to be sustainable and successful in other communities of this size for decades. We can learn from these examples of what has worked and also avoid what has not worked.

There is no implied priority in this ordering of five. Each of the proposed approaches could be implemented individually OR multiples may be combined into ONE integrated system utilizing different sections of the floodplain for complementary activities. All five approaches emphasize volunteer leadership, minimal infrastructure, and adaptation to natural cycles, ensuring long-term sustainability with minimal ongoing costs.


The specific approach examined in this document is the fourth one.

## Approach 4: Floodplain Foraging and Natural Movement Program

### Operations Management Summary

**Program Overview:**
The Floodplain Foraging and Natural Movement Program creates structured opportunities for physical activity through seasonal wild edible harvesting, natural movement, and ecological stewardship on FEMA-purchased floodplain properties. This approach combines nutrition education with varied physical activities while enhancing floodplain ecological function. The model is based on successful programs in river communities in Wisconsin, Oregon, and parts of New England that have operated sustainably for 20+ years.

**Core Components:**
- Seasonal wild edible identification and harvesting activities
- Natural movement sessions utilizing floodplain features
- Ecological stewardship workdays doubling as fitness activities
- Plant propagation of flood-tolerant edible species
- Educational components about floodplain ecology and nutrition
- Community processing and preparation events

**Volunteer Structure:**
- Program Coordinator (1-2 volunteers): Oversees overall planning
- Naturalist Leaders (4-6 volunteers): Lead identification and harvesting
- Movement Instructors (5-7 volunteers): Guide natural movement sessions
- Stewardship Team (6-8 volunteers): Coordinate ecological restoration
- Processing Team (4-6 volunteers): Organize harvest preparation events
- Education Team (3-4 volunteers): Develop learning materials

**Resource Requirements:**
- Field guides and identification materials
- Harvesting tools and containers
- Processing equipment (stored off-site)
- Native plant propagation supplies
- First aid supplies
- Communication system

**Implementation Timeline:**
1. **Month 1-2**: Map existing plant resources, identify restoration needs
2. **Month 3-4**: Train initial volunteer leaders, develop seasonal calendar
3. **Month 5-6**: Launch initial foraging and movement sessions
4. **Month 7-9**: Begin restoration activities, conduct regular sessions
5. **Month 10-12**: Host harvest celebration events, evaluate first season

**Sustainability Mechanisms:**
- Seasonal rotation following natural harvest calendar
- Restoration activities enhancing future harvests
- Skill development creating self-sustaining participant base
