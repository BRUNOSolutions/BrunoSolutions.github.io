#### Extreme TBD Warning

This is very much adhoc **To Be Determined** territory ... these are only five IDEAs for slightly more serious consideration  ...and a list of other brainstormed potentially implement-able approaches.


## Community Exercise and Fitness Improvement Programs for Floodplain Land

This is one of five PROPOSED approaches to transform FEMA-purchased floodplain properties from a maintenance burden into valuable community assets that use these proposed approach(s) to enhance physical fitness, ecological function, and community connection. By respecting the natural flood cycle and avoiding permanent structures, these programs create sustainable, resilient fitness opportunities while honoring the essential role of floodplains in watershed health.

The approaches, each with **no budget outlays from the City**, utilize nothing but vacant FEMA floodplain land and volunteer labor from those who commit [with a suggested $50/yr donation to defray administrative expense] sign up to participate physically in making these social community fitness-betterment approaches work, are as follows:

1) Walking Trail Network
2) Fitness Equipment Circuit
3) Field Sports Program
4) Foraging and Natural Movement Program
5) Cultural Heritage Fitness Trail

The specific approach examined in this document is the fourth one.

## Approach 4: Floodplain Foraging and Natural Movement Program

### Operations Management Summary

**Program Overview:**
The Floodplain Foraging and Natural Movement Program creates structured opportunities for physical activity through seasonal wild edible harvesting, natural movement, and ecological stewardship on FEMA-purchased floodplain properties. This approach combines nutrition education with varied physical activities while enhancing floodplain ecological function. The model is based on successful programs in river communities in Wisconsin, Oregon, and parts of New England that have operated sustainably for 20+ years.

**Core Components:**
- Seasonal wild edible identification and harvesting activities
- Natural movement sessions utilizing floodplain features
- Ecological stewardship workdays doubling as fitness activities
- Plant propagation of flood-tolerant edible species
- Educational components about floodplain ecology and nutrition
- Community processing and preparation events

**Volunteer Structure:**
- Program Coordinator (1-2 volunteers): Oversees overall planning
- Naturalist Leaders (4-6 volunteers): Lead identification and harvesting
- Movement Instructors (5-7 volunteers): Guide natural movement sessions
- Stewardship Team (6-8 volunteers): Coordinate ecological restoration
- Processing Team (4-6 volunteers): Organize harvest preparation events
- Education Team (3-4 volunteers): Develop learning materials

**Resource Requirements:**
- Field guides and identification materials
- Harvesting tools and containers
- Processing equipment (stored off-site)
- Native plant propagation supplies
- First aid supplies
- Communication system

**Implementation Timeline:**
1. **Month 1-2**: Map existing plant resources, identify restoration needs
2. **Month 3-4**: Train initial volunteer leaders, develop seasonal calendar
3. **Month 5-6**: Launch initial foraging and movement sessions
4. **Month 7-9**: Begin restoration activities, conduct regular sessions
5. **Month 10-12**: Host harvest celebration events, evaluate first season

**Sustainability Mechanisms:**
- Seasonal rotation following natural harvest calendar
- Restoration activities enhancing future harvests
- Skill development creating self-sustaining participant base
- Documentation building community knowledge base
- Recipe sharing extending utilization of harvests
- Propagation activities ensuring future resource availability

**Measured Outcomes:**
- Participation in various program activities
- Quantity and diversity of ethical harvests
- Acres improved through stewardship
- Physical activity hours generated
- Participant knowledge development
- Community connections formed

### Project Implementation Summary

**Resource Mapping and Stewardship Planning:**
- Conduct comprehensive plant inventory of floodplain properties
- Identify existing wild edible populations and enhancement opportunities
- Map natural features suitable for movement activities
- Create restoration priority list for degraded areas
- Develop seasonal activity calendar based on natural cycles
- Design ethical harvesting guidelines ensuring sustainability

**Movement Program Development:**
- Create "natural parkour" routes utilizing floodplain features
- Design variable-intensity movement sessions for different abilities
- Develop age-appropriate activities for family participation
- Create specialized movement sequences mimicking harvesting activities
- Design floodplain-specific movement challenges
- Establish progressive skill development framework

**Foraging Curriculum Design:**
- Create seasonal identification guides for safe foraging
- Develop hands-on workshops for each major edible species
- Create harvest quantity guidelines ensuring sustainability
- Design processing and preservation techniques for each food type
- Develop nutrition information for wild edibles
- Create comparative information with commercial counterparts

**Ecological Enhancement Activities:**
- Identify appropriate native edible species for propagation
- Design restoration workdays doubling as fitness activities
- Create invasive species removal protocols and events
- Develop seed collection and propagation workshops
- Design habitat enhancement projects for wildlife support
- Create monitoring protocols tracking ecological improvements

**Community Engagement Elements:**
- Design community harvest celebrations
- Create skill-sharing workshops on food preparation
- Develop "community supported foraging" distribution system
- Establish documentation project recording traditional uses
- Create seasonal recipe collection featuring wild edibles
- Design annual "Floodplain Feast" celebration event

**Safety and Accessibility Framework:**
- Develop comprehensive plant identification verification system
- Create clear harvesting guidelines preventing toxic look-alike collection
- Design progressive introduction to movement activities
- Establish weather and flooding monitoring protocols
- Create emergency response system for all activities
- Design adapted activities ensuring broad participation
