# You have to THINK about where your skills need to be in a month, in a year, in five years

*Stop being the kind of recalcitranty idiot who forces himself to be a backward-thinking idiot stuck thinking about things in the rear view mirror.

*[Technology made politics and media IRRELEVANT](https://twitter.com/MarkBruns/status/1750223408401400314) ... most people get this, ie that's why participation in politics continues to fall ... but many people are stuck thinking that the best practices for how we did things yesterday was good enough.*

You ***could*** go to [Water & Wastewater Equipment, Treatment and Transport Show (WWETT)](https://www.wwettshow.com/en/home.html) February 2025 ... but WWETT, USED TO BE BETTER, back in 2021, when [like many industry tradeshows] was optimized for virtual attendees, because people were SCARED about some pandemic hoax ... it might be true that maybe you could get some hands-on time using some of the expoxy, fiberglass liners and equipment from the folks at [Form-A-Drain®](https://www.formadrainsolutions.com/resource-library), but do you really NEED to experience WWETT physically, in-person to get it? What else are you missing because you are wasting time travelling to WWETT ... or any other tradeshow.  

        *HINT: The same principle at work here applies to ALL other forms of education ... there are VERY FEW things that you see in person that are worth the cost of commuting or travelling to be physically  trapped somewhere participating in those things ... there ARE some things where the experience matters, eg violent offenders prison; but the events that matter enough to attend are VERY FEW in number ... and given the increased productivity of someone with a modicum of AI skills, the bar is being raised much higher EVERY SINGLE SECOND by the increased producivity of AI ... the ACCELERATION in the human skillset is stunning, almost terrifying ... we have NEVER experienced such a rapid improvement in productivity possible through human interaction as right now ... it's AI driven ... and sewer drain tech is just one example.*

Of course, those of who follow topics like steam-cured sewer drain liners understand why those thing have a decades-long field-proven track record in eliminating the mess and cost of traditional dig-and-replace as well as performance issues generated by conventional cured in place plastic (CIPP) methods. Because they are 5 times stronger than ASTM standards, [Form-A-Drain®](https://www.formadrainsolutions.com/resource-library)'s thin VOC-free epoxy and fiberglass liners are ultra-strong and practically indestructible ... sure, [there ARE lots and lots of alternatives, and more all of the time](https://g.co/bard/share/a7d3bc496e90) ... but, that's kinda THE POINT of AI.

The production possibility curve expansion coming as a result of AI means that today's best answers are 2nd best answers as soon as we see them, ie ***it's not JUST nobody can afford to be the kind of idiot who wastes time driving.***  It's that PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE WITH USING AI IS CHANGING HOW PEOPLE THINK AND COLLABORATIVELY INVENT AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS.  Unless you are an idiot, [AI is re-hardwiring your brain to be more optimally creative by thinking intuitively, more speculatively, focusing more on where your skills and the capability of AI is going to be in a month, in a year, in five years](https://twitter.com/MarkBruns/status/1750275248283341281) ... rather than forcing yourself to be a backward-thinking idiot stuck thinking about things in the rear view mirror.
