## Extreme TBD Warning

This is very much adhoc **To Be Determined** territory.  *I am* **only just starting** *to* ***vibe engineer*** *these different ideas. Ultimately I intend to adapt the five community fitness proposals as approaches to take advantage of FEMA-purchased floodplain land, focusing on building fitness and wellness while respecting floodplain restrictions (no permanent structures, fences, or anything that would be damaged by flooding).*


## Community Exercise and Fitness Improvement Programs for Floodplain Land

Each of these five PROPOSED approaches transforms FEMA-purchased floodplain properties from a maintenance burden into valuable community assets that enhance physical fitness, ecological function, and community connection. By respecting the natural flood cycle and avoiding permanent structures, these programs create sustainable, resilient fitness opportunities while honoring the essential role of floodplains in watershed health.

The approaches, each utlizing floodplain land and volunteers who sign up to make the approach work, are as follows:

1) Walking Trail Network
2) Fitness Equipment Circuit
3) Field Sports Program
4) Foraging and Natural Movement Program
5) Cultural Heritage Fitness Trail

There is no implied priority in this ordering. Each of the proposed approaches could be implemented individually OR multiples may be combined into ONE integrated system utilizing different sections of the floodplain for complementary activities. All five approaches emphasize volunteer leadership, minimal infrastructure, and adaptation to natural cycles, ensuring long-term sustainability with minimal ongoing costs.
