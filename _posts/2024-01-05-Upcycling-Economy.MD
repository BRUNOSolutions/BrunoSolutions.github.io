**Upcycling** is a FIGHT... or an outright WAR, if you will ... AGAINST the evils of engineered-in obsolescence.

Converting waste materials or useless products into new materials or products of better quality or a higher environmental value is MASSIVELY less wasteful than landfilling the old junk and mining cobalt and lithim for brand new solar panels. The carbon footprint of making new stuff is why China and India now are in the role of being the world's biggest polluters ... because the materials are processed in China and India and the finish goods or components are exported to the "clean" economies.

Fixering and re-hacking refurbed crap could be done as the basis of a SOCIAL NETWORK ... or, more correctly, a social EDUCATION network ... there's more to than just straightening bent nails from a torn down corn crib. There's a lot of knowledge in old junk, especially old junk that was sold five or ten years ago ... this KNOWLEDGE leads to troubleshooting and hacking and makering ... which is an important meta-SKILL [which is about not quitting or giving up and just getting out the credit card ... if COMMUNITIES can learn together how to upcycle things that somebody bought new five or ten or 25 years, they can GENERALLY always be improving their lifestyles ON THE CHEAP ...making things better than they were before, for one-tenth or one-hundredth of the cost of buying new stuff.

Upcycling ALSO applies to HEALTH ... and USING the body to lift things, clean up stuff and generally stay physically active ... RATHER than jumping in a car and driving to the big box store and getting a giant ass hamburger and shake on the drive-thru, because people are too busy to actually cook their own food.

There's even a role in the upcycling economy for the dumb kid in the class, ie that generative AI stuff that halluces the worthless cliche answers ... precisely because much of the upcycling process is about finding old manuals and design artifacts to recover the cliche designs that were popular but now we've forgotten about ... so we'll have to make new and re-learn the old cliches, just at 1000X the cost.
