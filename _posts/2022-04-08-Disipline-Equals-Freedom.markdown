***Changing your habits to change yourself.*** Develop your own methods to trick your current lazy self in going along your future, more disciplined self. Always be leveling up your discipline.

If you need ideas for where to start ... the most important enabling habit which makes other improvements in habits easier is a commitment to embracing ***minimalism, mobility and agility***. You need less than you think you do; when you have made do with less, reduce more ... the point of severe minimalism is better agility and having the habits necessary to be able to make the best of everything [around you], when you have nothing. 

Consume less of all things, but especially FAST in your diet ... get over the stupid fears; you are not going to destroy muscle; you are not going to die ... one-meal-a-day eating, caloric restriction and even extended 36-hour and 48-hour fasting regiments are all about regaining control of your appetite.

Develop the mindset, mental tools, pscyological tricks to help you develop the habit of pushing PAST your limits in ten different things every day ... maybe something like language lessons, but especially do this in physical exercise or calisthenics, like burpees or push-ups ... even when you don't feel like it -- just get started. JUST START SLOWLY, but get out there and warm up -- then do better, more perfect reps, but push hard/fast to that point where you want to stop, then start counting the reps till you really just cannot go any more.
