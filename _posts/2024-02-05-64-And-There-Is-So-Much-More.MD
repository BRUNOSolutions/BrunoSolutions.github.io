# I USED TO BE A LOT [LIKE YOU WERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson)

I learned *from LBJ's life's work* to AVOID the trap of being a political centralizer like LBJ.

In my 20s ... I started off being someone who imagined that I could deliver a better world by being a centralizer ... dams, highways, airports, schools, hospitals, policies, laws, regulations, etc. ... and I was completely, totally, absolutely DEAD wrong.

I have become a radical voluntarist ... an anarcho-capitalist technologist ... but mostly, I have become a CHRISTIAN with a mission to help people to THINK more like Jesus Christ ... that means no churches, no organizations and absolutely NOTHING that looks like coercive power ... in other words, I do not believe that Paul thought at all like Christ ... that worked for Paul in Paul's time ... but it will not work for us in our future.

***We cannot afford to WORSHIP wealth, power, authority ANY MORE ... we must THINK like Christ thought and NOT like Paul thought.***
