# Free markets are an asset-weighted reflection of the current will of the public with skin in the game.

When you do not really have any skin in the game, your opinion does not really matter that much. Sure ideas can matter ... but not until those ideas are adopted by those who have the will to turned their ideas into reality. 

Mostly, we should be talking about LIVES ... and what 9 billion UNIQUE individual human beings will do with each of the 86,400 seconds of their days ... the WILL of any one of those unique individual human beings would be more than sufficient to make that person the most wealthy person in the world in less than half a century ... most people believe that wealth is matter of intelligence. It isn't. Not exactly. Wealth is a matter of WILL. 

Imagine a HUSTLING **strong-willed** ten-year-old kid with a stake of just $1. That kid would be able to figure out how to turn that $1 into $1.03 in two weeks of hustling ... and nobody would really even notice. That kid could continue developing hustling skills and business acumen and turn that $1 into $2 after a year by the time the kid was 11, and STILL nobody would notice. The same applies for the progression from $2 to $4 at age 12, from $4 to $8 at age 13, from $8 to $16 at age 14, from $16 to $32 at age 15, from $32 to $64 at age 16, from $64 to $128 at age 17, from $128 to $256 at age 18, from $256 to $512 at age 19, from $512 to $1024 at age 20 ... NOBODY is really going to notice another **strong-willed** 20-year-old kid with $1024 in savings ... that may start to change as $1,024 stake goes to $32,768 at 25, but probably not.

The **strong-willed** kid is probably not even going to be noticed $1,048,576 at 30 ... **becasue people might notice the money and imagine how THEY could do more with it, but they NEVER the WILL** *because humans are NEVER genuinely empathetic when it comes to strong-willed successes* ... NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.

But by the time, the successful kid has $33,554,432 at 35, the advisors will crawl out of the woodwork  ... by the time, the compounded will is at $1,073,741,824 when the kid is 40, the world of entirely cluelss fin journos will have labeled the kid as another unicorn success; whereas the liberal commie journos will assure people that the success is the product of wealthy, attractive, advantaged parents ... by the time the kid turns 50 being worth over trillion, the kooks will be dominant, conspiracy theorists will blame the kid on aliens whereas sychophats will claim that the kid did what they did and they'd be just as successful *if not for the giant bag of excuses they were blessed with...* 

But, the fact of the matter is that BEHIND EVERY SUCCESS STORY ... **it was always the WILL** ... the RELENTLESS, indominantable WILL to perfect the discipline of doing something akin to turning $1 into $1 and 3c every two weeks [which probably involved finding a way to give people [who had 1.06 to spend] $1.06 of VALUE and selling it to them for less than the $1.06 they would have paid someone else].  

BEHIND EVERY SUCCESS STORY ... **it's always the WILL** ... it is ALWAYS VOLUNTARY ... although it is a result of insane levels of compounding of small neuropathways of voluntary responses ... success is neurovoluntary ... the will is a compounded, learned, developed and exercised neuropathway. 

# We are not born with a strong-will; we BECOME strong-willed.

***The will is the governing force at the core of ALL human reality.*** You can control what is projected onto your conscious mind to a large degree; with discipline and repetitive training, you can control what is projected on to your subconscious and unconscious mind to a lesser degree ... you are not really directly in charge of your will, but you control the projection.

## Free Will and Free Thinking

*We shoulld be be extremely careful about ever joining groups or ever taking any oaths.* There is probably no oath that has ever been divised that is actually worthy of us. Oaths are a matter of human desire and pride RATHER than a matter of following our Creator's will for us.  Freedom of mind or freedom of thought becomes next to impossible after one has joined a group or any kind of political or religous movement.

Your mind is the only wealth that you possess; your mind is what drives your ability to improve your habits, improve your discipline -- and, of course, your mind is everything when it comes to open source development or extending the realms of human knowledge and Science. *In this existence, your MIND is everything ... espeically for self-governance ... don't abdicate your responsibility to be in control of your mind."

The will is not about reasoning, but an irrational, unconscious urge or love in relation to which the intellect represents a secondary phenomenon.

Humans are exceptionally talented from very early ages in making excuses or  intellectualizing or rationalizing reasons and arguments for the direction our [largely unconscious or subconscious] will directs us to do. Enormous efforts are dedicated to advertisin, entertainment and educational programming to shape the will of individual humans ... humans can *control the projector* but most are either too lazy or so thoroughly programmed already that they do not understand any need to do this, ie they have already succumbed to the programming to join the *will of the herd*. 

You could predict what someone zealously BELIEVES by looking at what sports, news, entertainment programming they enjoy watching ... you can also predict how people will spend their time working as salary/wage slaves by looking at which advertisements for automobiles, home furnishings or lifestyle products are supporting those enjoyed programs.

Thus [psychological **Voluntarism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(psychology)#Wundt_and_structuralism) or [philosopical **Voluntarism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)) is NOT a political persausion ... it is more anti-political or aggressively apolitical in nature.


Someone who is truly a [psychological **Voluntarist**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(psychology)#Wundt_and_structuralism) or a [philosopical **Voluntarist**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntarism_(philosophy)) would be extremely careful about joining something like a church, or a political party or any kind of movement ... all movements are about peer-pressure and programming the membership ... it is not just that the **labels** of being a [Libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Libertarianism) or [Anarchist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Anarchism) are really not at all well understood by anyone, including the so-called leaders of these movements, it is also that Voluntarist recognized why associations and public candidacies effectively pollute or even destroy the ability for one to remain objective and *in control of the projector* that is shaping the unconscious and subconscious thoughts underpinning the unexamined assumption driving one's *supposed* free will.

Thus, a philosophical or psychological Voluntarist might choose to state general agreement with a **political** [***Voluntaryist's***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism) principal beliefs stemming from the principles of [self-ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership) and [non-aggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle) ... but a serious philosophical Voluntarist would be very cautious about joining any kind of [***Voluntaryist***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism) organization or getting involved in any political association.

## Where entrepreneurial activitys, freelancing or topics like asynchronous work fit in this 

I am personally biased; I have a STRONG personal affinity for asynchronous development or and independent work projects which can be managed by looking at the regular continuous sharing of progress and work artifacts ... I see workplaces, meetings and conferences as subtly coercive in nature, ie "WHY is it important for me to physically attend?" ... I strongly prefer 360-degree TRANSPARENCY ... this might involve looking at a dashboard that might look like a GitHub or GitLab commitgraph, but has a wealth of extra information underneath, which can be transparently drilled down into to see discussions and code.  

There's really no good excuse for something like a conference or meeting anymore ... except as a signal of FAILURE in being able to manage an ASYNCHRONOUS communication format. It's one thing to fail, it is inexcusable to fail because some idiot did not even try.

### Not everyone is ready YET ... SO???

GET READY ... but a degree of patience is in order. ***As with left-handedness, the strong preference for ASYNCH.work might not seem normal to all***, to gregarious people or people who prefer going to conferences or different aspects of travel and different aspects of a physical social life, eg dining or going to clubs.* 

Since I bat ASYNCH-handed, I believe that I am better able to see opportunities in ASYNCH.work. Those opportunities will be obvious to some; to others, they never bothered looking at ways to improve efficiencies before ... because they had it easy, they never HAD TO look for efficiency improvements in order to have a chance to have work or to survive.

At its core ASYNCH.work is about achieving a tenfold increase in efficiency and throughput -- it's about slashing times to launch and really developing speed as a competitive advantage.
# It's important to NEVER look in the rear view mirror

Never spend time with people who are too intent on looking back.  Do not bother them if they want to do that ... never live in a setting sun world; always look to rising sun and the dawn of what can be created in a new day. Just understand why the perks of travel and conferences cost more than the reimbursed expenses.

# Always have a pyramidal planning horizon

* VISION ... love your Creator / your WHY, live mindfully in prayer
* PLAN ... considering your vision and actions, constantly re-strategie
* D0 ... implement your strategey, devise tactics, training, get ready
* CHECK ... review, re-measure before *cutting* or striking tactically
* ACT ... do the most important thing possible, do it right NOW

The important part of this pyramid is to PLAN the 10,000 most important moments of your 86,400 second day rigorously ... that's one sec in 8, not even 3 full hours ... but FOCUS intently on the most vital 10,000 seconds ... and keep working; working to relax, to stay in touch ... but not with a particular plan.  Once you get in the habit of this focused pyramid of life, you will probably understand why you cannot sustain more than 3 intense hours in a day. The moments should all be treasured, but there's a different in terms of intensity.  

You vision will always inform what your are going to be planning, doing, checking, action upon ... and your actions will always, to an infinitestimally small degree always re-calibrate your vision. You should generally aim to gather intelligence ... and intelligence, like all information, can only have value when it surprises you, makes you uncomfortable and causes you to adjust. Get comfortable being in slight discomfort or unease, so that you are agile and able to constantly rebalancing ... as if you were a toddler just learning to walk.

You actions will affect your intelligence gathering and what you are measuring, monitoring or listening to most closely ... just as your ability to monitor, observe, check, measure, listen will impact what the slightly larger tactical sense of what are doing or implementing or what battle you are moving toward ... what you can confidently do or implement or achieve will affect your general strategic outlook and planning of the next phase ... and your planning will impact your vision, your WHY, your conversations with your Creator ... but **the mindful Life is resting in a state of constant, involuntarily reflective awareness.** 

It is worth repeating for emphasis. Your WHY drives your PLAN drives your DOING drives your CHECKING drives your ACTIONS ... and your actions influence what you check which influences how/what bigger things you do as your confidence in doing things affects your planning and strategy and the success/failure of those plans drives your vision. 

**The mindful life is a matter of constant, unceasing nowness, spent in reflection on this pyramid structure.**

The scale of the pyramid is something that you can play with or make work for you.  I used to do project management using holidays, eg Super Bowl Sunday, Thanksgiving, as key dates for big milestones ... the holiday was a way for everyone involved to think about a push to achieving milestone, because people are social creatures and they do not necessarily really think in terms of days -- instead, they tend to think in terms of parties, vacations, events, celebrations, family gatherings ... longing for special times to be spent with very best friends and lovers.

In my life as a monk, however ... a 10,000 days horizon with 100 day projects works better, so projects are 100 day things ... but that because I can work on what I choose to work on. I don't tend to especially recognize or celebrate holidays as a person, any more; they tend to surprise me, "Oh -- that's right tomorrow is the Fourth of July!" 

I tend to prefer looking ahead, at the 10,000 day vision, in a state of mindful contemplation of upcoming wars, battles, fights, training and preparation. A 100 day push is not just the next 3 months, 1 week and a couple days for getting re-organized/regrouped -- it's also three sets of four week sprints, with two week half-sprint and couple days for getting re-organized/regrouped/re-scoped/re-planned for the next push or set of sprints ... of course, I can adapt when things change or opporunties arise, but I tend to kinda like my 100-day planning windows AND the convenient numerical fact that 10,000 days is 100 100-day planning windows ... of course, others might find a different framework than 10,000 works better.

### Compare different time scales to find what works for you.

Just please do not treat time/project management as unnecesssay ... please do not go through life, just living one day after another, killing time ... think in terms of the BIG WHY, with the Plan, Do, Check, Act reflective cycle ... which drives each DAY.

* 1 day, 10 days, 100 days, 1000 days, 10,000 days (27 1/3 years)
* 1 day, 7 days, 49 days, 343 days, 2401 days (6 1/2 years)
* 1 day, 5 days, 25 days, 125 days, 625 days (1 2/3 years)
* 1 day, 3 days, 9 days, 27 days, 81 days ... *maybe you have cancer*

Keep your horizon, until you KNOW that your horizon has changed -- you will KNOW when the end is definitely sooner ... and when that end is DEFINITELY sooner -- your planning horizon will, but you can still think about it in the same five order time horizon.

# VISUALIZE the architecture of the future of your life

Think in terms of the LONG TERM ... your idea of the long term might vary ... for me, I think about the next 10,000 days or approximately 27 years and 4 and 1/2 months ... there are practical reasons why 10,000 days makes sense for me. 10,000 days is roughly in line with what is the **AVERAGE** life expectation is for someone of my age and my level of health/fitness, ie someone in their early 60s with no immediately threatening health conditions. 

After all, a good proportion of people in their early 60s already have some showstopper medical condition, something that demands regular daily medication OR they really need a marijauna supplement or stiff drink or two or three every day to deal with stress OR are perhaps are a cancer survivor still on heavy pharma therapy regime OR already have some heart condition or hypertension issue OR might already be a Type II diabetic. The point is that [AVERAGE life expectancy for the ENTIRE populations of 62 year old males is about 20 years](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html), but the life expectancy for HEALTHY males is probably closer being around 90 ON AVERAGE. 

Of course, there are no gaurantee ... so we enjoy working on what matters to us and by working on these things, we get to LIVE life NOW ... without ever thinking that we are old so we DESERVE to live like a tourist, or some senile retiree just on an AARP vacation ... rather than ***building*** for the next 10,000 days.

# PLAN concretely for the next 1000 days ... but these strategies will change

The point of planning is to DRIVE looking forward ... of course, you will  adapt, steer, guide, revise, but you will need a destination or as you develop your PLANS for the next 1000 days ... this is the foreseeable vision part of the PDCA cycle

# DO in the next 100 days

Using something like an AGILE work breakdown structure which you will manage and check in the next 10 days, IMPLEMENT the next phase of the plan in the next 100 days ... roll up your sleeves and do the necessary sprints, thinking about what your objective will be over the next three or four months. This is roughly analogous to the growing season in farming.

# CHECK the impact of your 10 day sprint

Develop your daily workflow with 10 day sprint horizons.

# Each day, ACT upon the one Big Thing that is MOST important for today
