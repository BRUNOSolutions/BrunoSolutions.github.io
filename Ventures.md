***Venturing*** is our process of *intelligence gathering*; it is about ***engaging*** the world economically, culturally, thematically.  

We READ and accelerate how we read, using curated lists and AI-recommenders to search better.

The point of annotification is read better, faster, more broadly, more deeply, to discern patterns better.

Our approach is to have roughly 125 venturing ideas in the hopper, but we actually only focus on about 25 venture themes each a month, approximately one per day.  

There are five venture themes that our weekly focus ... it changes; they do not necessarily rotate according to any set plan; we could focus on the same five next week, but that's unlikely. 

There will be only ONE main venture theme that we are *sorta really* focusing on, every single day, at this time ... the main thing is to focus on the process of intelligence gathering and venturing.
