Ventures are about developing a PRODUCT or SERVICE that is good enough at serving its users, that users subscribe to the development process in some way or another that MONETIZES and SUSTAINS the product or service.

Campaigns are extremely hard work ... ventures and monetization help pay developers bills so that they are free to create and develop ... even though monetization is another gigantic hurdle, these ventures associated with political campaigns, voter education and outreach are still about SERVING others FIRST.

## Products are different than PROJECTS.  

FREE open source software is about a creative development community that expresses its joy over the FREEDOM to SERVE others ... even those others who are unlikely to ever thank you or the developers like you who are committed to SHARING something of value with others.

If you are thinking about running for office in the future, you should not be doing it UNLESS you intend to SERVE others FIRST.

If you are actually halfway serious about your commitment to services, you should be developing and using open source software to build the apps that help advance your cause of SERVING your constituents FIRST.  

Maybe you will get elected ... maybe you won't ... that does not matter; what matters is how diligent you are in commitment to SERVE other FIRST. You are FREE to show your commitment to the principles of freedom and service ... or you can be just another politicians like all the rest of them.
