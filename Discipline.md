***Embrace the SUCK*** of tedious discipline building.

# Change the habits of being yourself ... help others first

Discipline is not something you are born with; discipline is something that you build. Try to stay humble as you learn but just [never stop learning or getting ideas from others](https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1513290733624737797). The most important discipline is humility -- you need to stay way the fuck away from those who exhibit no humility or fallibility. 

This campaign is all about helping people ... especially helping people on their own personal journey to build discipline ... helping to coach and building discipline are what the Ventures and the FREE Open Source development projects are all about.

If you are actually halfway serious about your commitment to services, you should be developing and using open source software to build the apps that help advance your cause of SERVING your constituents FIRST.
