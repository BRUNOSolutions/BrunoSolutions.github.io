# Change the habits of being yourself

Discipline is not something you are born with; discipline is something that you build. 

Improving your discipline like learning a language, ie it is basically impossible for people who decide that they just can't or won't do it. Improving your discipline begins with changing your mind. Anyone who NEEDS to learn another languages can learn other languages; it's horrendously difficult, so some just decide to die instead. In order to improve your discipline, you will need to experience the frustration of being a child and you will need to approach things with the curiosity and need to continually ask WHY, so that your can better know your WHY ... if you think that you already know your WHY and don't need to learn, you have basically decided that you will die RATHER than learn [from your Creator] what your WHY is. The most important discipline is to never stop learning, never stop trying frustrating things, **never stop failing.** *Change the habits of being yourself.*
