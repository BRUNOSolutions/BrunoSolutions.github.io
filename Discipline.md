# Stop buying the HYPE; you will get the Slough of Despair

***Embrace the SUCK*** of tedious discipline building.

# Change the habits of being yourself

Discipline is not something you are born with; discipline is something that you build. Try to stay humble as you learn but just [never stop learning or getting ideas from others](https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1513290733624737797). The most important discipline is humility -- you need to stay way the fuck away from those who exhibit no humility or fallibility. 

***Humans fail; humans who stop improving their habits, fail more and fail harder.*** Recalcitrance kills. Improving discipline is not only impossible for people who have decided that they are not going to try anything or fail anymore -- by not improving, discipline atrophies and declines rapidly ... the delusions become more beguiling as dementia and senility take over.

Maybe you could think of the process of improving your discipline like the processes of learning a language, ie there's always another idiom or an expansion of vocabulary, another parable or cultural nuance, another facet to explore. Most importantly, more options is not about using MORE words -- there's always more to learn about editing, poetry, lyrics, copywriting and generally using far fewer words to paint a clearer picture and to say far more but to say it with concision.  

***Improving your discipline is always about with changing your mind FIRST.*** It's going to be horrendously difficult and embarrassing. That's why some, maybe most, will just decide to die instead. In order to improve your discipline, you will need to experience the frustration of being a child who cannot get what they want and cannot even express what the problem is.  Embracing that level of failure means you will need to approach things with wonder and curiosity ... you will need to continually ask WHY, so that your can better know your WHY. 

[When you think that you already know your WHY and don't need to learn](https://twitter.com/thelahdeda/status/1513374440117379072/photo/1), you are basically standing on the summit of ***peak stupid*** in the inescapable progression known as the [Dunning-Kruger affect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) ... there is ALWAYS another *valley of despair* on the ahead for those who have decided they do not need to impove their habits of themselves.

Many will decide that they are ready die RATHER than improve their habits and to improve their spiritual discipline ...  to walk closer to their Creator to discover what their WHY is. They may fail to realize that their Creator created them to learn and may not be particularly interested in those who have learned all they want to learn out of life. Spiritual discipline is the most important discipline ... any soul with an eternal time horizon can never stop learning, never stop trying frustrating things, **never stop failing.** There's always room for *changing the habits of being yourself.*
