# SERVE your constituents FIRST! 

Stop doing political campaigns WRONG!

SERVE your constituents FIRST ... by enlisting them directly in becoming their own solution and being independent of you or any of your campaign promises.

DELIVER immediately by showing them how to dogfood their own toolsets and level up their skills. 

Enlist your allies, your peers, your friends by assisting them in the process of thinking about leveling up their skills to develop their own tools, so that their independence is sustainable and so that they can develop the next generation of their own tools.

These campaign solutions are all about dogfooding. SERVE everybody the dogfood that will help them to dogfood their future dogfood!
