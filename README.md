# Discipline Equals Freedom

*ALL of the solutions to your issues come down to what you are doing about your habits and your discipline.*

**ALL** of the solutions come down to ***depending much less on somebody else or any worrying about someone else. Instead, depend on and WORK your own discipline. If you want MORE freedom [for yourself, for anyone, for everyone], then work MORE on your discipline ... every second of every day.***

Discipline equals freedom ... the results of working on your habits may not be immediate, except that you will feel different about yourself immediately after you start and then get serious about maintaining and improving good habits. Discipline is the ONLY path to freedom, wealth or power over your life. ***Lasting success is not something that can be given to you.***

***Begin by reducing your vulnerabilities, addictions, co-morbidities and any needs.*** Maybe you cannot immediately remove these things, but you can work each second of each day to minimize the hold that they have over your freedom. There are no silver bullets or easy buttons ... reduction in weakness is a matter of slow, methodical boring discipline. It's takes constant, diligence attention to improving your effort over time. Discipline is simple, but it is not easy.
