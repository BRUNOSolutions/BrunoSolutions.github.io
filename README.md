# Discipline Equals Freedom

All of the solutions come down to ***depending much less on somebody else or any worrying about someone else. Instead, depend on and WORK your own discipline. If you want MORE freedom [for yourself, for anyone, for everyone], then work MORE on your discipline ... every second of every day.***  

*ALL of the solutions to your issues are about your discipline.*

Reduce your vulnerabilities, addictions and co-morbidities. Maybe you cannot immediately remove these things, but you can work each second of each day to minimize their impact. There are no silver bullets or easy buttons ... reduction in weakness is a matter of slow, methodical boring discipline. It's takes constant, diligence attention to improving your effort over time. Discipline is simple, but it is not easy. 

Discipline equals freedom ... Discipline is the ONLY way to freedom. ***Don't expect freedom to be handed to you.***
