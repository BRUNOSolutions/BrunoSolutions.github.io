# SERVE your constituents FIRST! 

Stop doing political campaigns WRONG! Stop pandering to whiners. Enlisting your constituents in the campaign of becoming their own solution and being independent of you or any politician's promises.

***SERVE your constituents FIRST!*** is a radically different political philosophy. It's neither right nor left, it is a forward-looking mindset of builders rather than a backward-looking mindset of whiners longing for a past that never was that they think they see in the rear view mirror. 

***SERVE your constituents FIRST!*** means that the campaign solutions or services are all about [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) ... that expression is about actually listening to your own advice and criticisms as you develop and extend the tools you use to develop the tools that churn out your development campaign. 

***SERVE your constituents FIRST!*** is about letting the dead bury the dead. and moving forward. True freedom and true independence from politicians, especially from politicians who pander to the gossips, victims, those who give up and complain rather than get down to business and fight.

***SERVE your constituents FIRST!*** is about choosing the independence and freedom that comes from the discipline of leveling up everyone's skills to build and develop their own tools. We're not in this campaign of building the discipline to build and develop alone. The INDEPENDENT thinkers are out there. That's why your campaign involves your friends, your peers, your allies who have chosen to not to be victims, but rather have chosen to be developers and builders, chosen to be INDEPENDENT.

***SERVE your constituents FIRST!*** is about REALLY ***serving*** your constituents by challenging them to build and develop their own solutions rather than pandering for the votes of losers who are encouraged to stay dependent and think like victims. The radically different anti-pandering, NO EXCUSES political philosophy is about a campaign of campaigners that embody and build the ***SERVE your constituents FIRST!*** movement.
